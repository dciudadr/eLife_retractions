        The free radical scavenging activity values were ranged from 0.7 to 1.41 mg/ml and 0.6 to 1.23 mg/ml, respectively for leaf and stem bark extracts. The amount of total phenolic contents of the extracts occurred in both leaf and bark in the range of 12 to 56.6 mg GAE/100 g and 16 to 58 mg GAE/100 g respectively. RP-HPLC analysis for flavonoids revealed the presence of two major flavonoid compounds, rutin and catechin. Kaempferol was in trace or absent. Methanol leaf extract showed significant low inhibitory effect against tested fungus

     Background
    </title>
    <p>
     Medicinal plants are known to be sourced of diverse nutrients and non-nutrient molecules. Many of the medicinal plants display antioxidant and antimicrobial properties which can protect the human body against both cellular oxidation reactions and pathogens. Antioxidants are vital substances which possess the ability to protect the body from damage caused by free radical induced oxidative stress [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B1"">
      1
     </xref>
     ]. There is an increasing interest in natural antioxidants, e.g., polyphenols, present in medicinal and dietary plants, which might help to prevent oxidative damage [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B2"">
      2
     </xref>
     ]. The presence of phenolic compounds (phenolic acids, polyphenols and flavonoids) in plants, herbs and spices, is gaining increasing attention because of their various functions, such as antioxidant activity and health benefits [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B3"">
      3
     </xref>
     ]. Thus, it is important to characterize different types of medicinal plants for their antioxidant and antimicrobial potentiality [

     </xref>
     -
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B6"">

     </xref>
     ]. Medicinal plants are known to produce certain bioactive molecules which are responsible for their antimicrobial properties [

     </xref>
     -
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B10"">

     </xref>
     ]. The substances that can inhibit pathogens and have little toxicity to host cells are considered as candidates for developing new antimicrobial drugs.

     The incidence of dermatophytic infections has increased considerably during the past several decades [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B11"">
      11
     </xref>
     ]. Dermatophytes are responsible for serious human pathogenic disorders in various parts of the world. Although control measures are available, they have limited effectiveness. Conventional antifungal agents such as chlorohexidine and imidazole derivatives have limited uses. Due to their common side effects such as hepatotoxicity, nausea, diarrhoea and impotency [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B12"">
      12
     </xref>
     ], the use is restricted in pregnant and the young people.
    </p>
    <p>
     In order to identify and develop the novel antimicrobial agent, a number of essential oils and extracts have been investigated extensively to achieve higher levels of human safety standards [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B13"">

     ,

      500 g of shade-dried pulverized plant materials were subjected to extraction in a Soxhlet apparatus successively with petroleum ether, chloroform and methanol, the volume of each solvent was 6 times the volume of plant extract. For each solvent, extraction was conducted until no more coloured matter was extracted. Solvent from each extracted mixture was evaporated to dryness using a rotary evaporator under reduce pressure at 40°C. All dried extracts were then kept in tightly fitting stopper bottles and stored in −4°C.

      The total phenolic content (TPC) in the extracts was determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu colorimetric method given by Singleton &amp; Rossi [
      <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B27"">
       27
      </xref>
      ]. Different concentrations of extracts were mixed with 1.0 ml of 10 fold diluted Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and 1 ml of saturated sodium carbonate solution. After allowing it to stand for 30 min at 30°C, the absorbance was measured at 725 nm with a UV-Visible spectrophotometer (Multiskan Spectrum, Thermo Scientific). Standard curve of gallic acid solution (10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 ppm) was prepared using the similar procedure. Total phenolic was calculated using a standard gallic acid curve and results were expressed as mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/100 g of extract.

      DPPH radical scavenging assay

      The scavenging activity of extracts on DPPH was determined using the method described by [
      <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B28"">
       28
      </xref>
      ]. This method depends on the reduction of purple DPPH to a yellow coloured diphenyl picrylhydrazine. The determination of the disappearance of free radicals was done using UV-visible spectrometer (Multiskan Spectrum, Thermo Scientific). The remaining DPPH which showed maximum absorption at 517 nm was measured. Each plant extract sample’s stock solution (1.0 mg/ml) was diluted to final concentrations of (0.6 .0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05 and 0.01) mg/ml, in ethanol. One ml of a 0.3 mM DPPH ethanol solution was added to 2.5 ml of sample solution of different concentrations. These are test solutions. One ml of ethanol was added to 2.5 ml of sample solution of different concentration. These are blank solutions. One ml DPPH solution plus 2.5 ml of ethanol was used as a negative control. The blank for this solution is ethanol. As DPPH is sensitive to light, it is exposed to the minimum possible light. These solutions were allowed to react at room temperature for 30 minutes. The absorbance values were measured and converted into the percentage antioxidant activity using the following equation:

      The flavonoid compounds present in the polar solvents can be separated by using Reverse Phase HPLC equipped with a photo-diode array detector (RP-HPLC-PDA). This establishes the light absorbance spectrum from visible and UV wavelengths of each detected compound, and show intense absorption in the UV region of the spectrum. Identification of the flavonoid compounds (Rutin, Catechin, Kaempferol) present in the extracts of leaves and barks of

The compounds were identified by comparing with standards of each identified compound using the retention time, the absorbance spectrum profile and also by running the samples after the addition of pure standards. The concentration of an individual flavonoid compounds (Rutin, Catechin, Kaempferol) in the plant extract was calculated based on peak height measurement and then finally converted to mg flavonoid/100 g DW.

Different concentrations of the extracts (9, 4.5, 2.25, 1.125 mg/ml) were prepared by two-fold dilution method. The graded concentrations of the extracts (20 μl) were deposited into the wells using micropipettes and left for 10 min at room temperature for diffusion. Negative and positive control was prepared using DMSO (final concentration of the DMSO in the highest concentration of plant extract tested did not exceed 0.4% (v/v) and did not affect the cell proliferation) and Amphotericin-B (16 μg/ml), respectively. The plates were inoculated at 32±2°C for 7–9 days. The experiment was repeated thrice and the average results were recorded in radial (mm).

      Flavonoid compounds analysis
     </title>
     <p>
      The solvent extracts were analysed by HPLC to quantify the selected parts of the plant. The established HPLC-UV method was successfully applied for the determination of the three major flavonoid compounds (Rutin, Catechin, Kaempferol) present in different parts of the plant,
      <italic>
       X. longifolium
      </italic>
      . The contents of these compounds distributed in different parts of the plant, bark and leaf were shown in Table
      <xref ref-type=""table"" rid=""T1"">
       1
      </xref>
      . It can be seen that these compounds showed significant variations between the plants parts tested. The content of Rutin in leaf extract was found to be higher in petroleum ether (0.51%) than in chloroform (0.22%) and methanol extracts (0.12%) whereas in bark extract was resulted to be higher in petroleum ether (0.67%) than in chloroform (0.65%) and methanol extracts (0.56%) (Table
      <xref ref-type=""table"" rid=""T1"">
       1
      </xref>
      ). The content of Catechin in leaf extract was found to be higher in petroleum ether extract (1.88%) than in methanol (1.72%) and chloroform (1.56%) whereas in bark extract was studied to be higher in petroleum ether extract (4.29%) than in chloroform (1.73%) and methanol extract (1.24%) (Table
      <xref ref-type=""table"" rid=""T1"">
       1
      </xref>
      ). However, the contents of Rutin and Catechin presence found to be more in bark extracts than the leaf extracts. From the Kaempferol content studies it was in trace or absent.

      Relation among DPPH scavenging activity, total Phenolic, and its flavonoid compounds
     </title>
     <p>
      According to the results of the current study correlation between the content of either total phenolic or individual flavonoids and DPPH scavenging activity was calculated. There were a positive linear relationship between total phenolic content and DPPH scavenging activity of both leaf and bark extracts (

      = 0.98 respectively). A highly significant correlation was found in bark extracts between total phenolic content and DPPH scavenging activity. The correlation with catechin and rutin in leaf and bark extracts were

      Anti-dermatophytic activity and MIC of extracts

     <p>
      The extracts exhibited a moderate anti-dermatophytic activity against the tested fungal pathogens. As shown in Table
      <xref ref-type=""table"" rid=""T2"">

      </xref>
      , different solvent extracts from leaf (9 mg/well) showed potent inhibitory effect on the growth of

      3270 and

      4878 (19 mm in radial) by methanol. Again, different solvent extracts from bark exhibited the efficacy on the inhibition by petroleum ether of

      4878 (15 mm in radial) against all the fungal pathogens tested (Table
      <xref ref-type=""table"" rid=""T2"">
       2
      </xref>
      ). Thus comparative evaluation of the extracts showed variation in the levels of activity against the tested fungal strains (Table
      <xref ref-type=""table"" rid=""T2"">
       2
      </xref>
      ). This variation of susceptibility from one species to another is evident from their zones of inhibition. In general,

      3270 and

       T. ajelloi

      4878 were found to be the most susceptible organisms to both methanol extracts of leaf and bark and requires chemical characterization for its bioactive principle. The diluted concentration of each extracts (4.5, 2.25, 1.125 mg/ml) did not show anti-dermatophytic activity.

Highest sensitivity was shown by the entire test microbial towards leaf methanol extract against fungus

     In this study, the extraction of both leaf and bark was performed using three solvents of increasing polarity. Different solvent systems have been used for extractions from plant material [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B38"">
      38
     </xref>
     ] because the extraction yield is dependent on the polarity and the nature of solvents [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B39"">
      39
     </xref>
     ]. Trabelsi

     </italic>
     [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B40"">

     </xref>
     ] showed that the methanol is the best solvent to extract total phenolics. The ANOVA for all parameters assessed a significant influence on phenolic contents, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of plant extracts. ANOVA is just a material used to look for significant differences.
    </p>

     The antioxidant activity of the extracts was determined using a DPPH scavenging assay. The DPPH assay is often used to evaluate the ability of antioxidants to scavenge free radicals which are known to be a major factor in biological damages caused by oxidative stress. This assay is known to give reliable information concerning the antioxidant ability of the tested compounds [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B41"">
      41
     </xref>
     ]. The principle of the assay is based on the colour change of the DPPH solution from purple to yellow as the radical is quenched by the antioxidant [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B42"">
      42
     </xref>
     ].
    </p>

     These results were consistent with the findings of many research groups who reported such correlation between total phenolic content and SCa
     <sub>

     </sub>
     antioxidant activity [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B43"">
      43
     </xref>
     -
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B46"">
      46
     </xref>
     ]. The Folin–Ciocalteu assay used herein provides a crude estimation of the total phenolic compounds present in the extracts. Since it is not specific to polyphenols any interfering compounds may react with the reagent and thus leads to noticeable elevated phenolic concentrations [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B47"">
      47
     </xref>
     ]. In addition, phenolic compounds respond differently in this assay when the number of phenolic groups varies [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B27"">
      27
     </xref>
     ]. Several studies showed good correlation between total phenols and antioxidant activity [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B42"">
      42
     </xref>
     ,
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B48"">
      48
     </xref>
     -
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B50"">
      50
     </xref>
     ].
    </p>
    <p>
     Correlation between the content of either total phenol or individual flavonoids and antioxidant capacity data indicate that the antioxidant activity was obtained directly from phenolics, and also particularly catechin and rutin, and assures other experiments that mentioned the same vital role of catechin and rutin in lipid peroxidation inhibition [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B51"">
      51
     </xref>
     ,
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B52"">
      52
     </xref>
     ].
    </p>
    <p>
     In the present study, methanol leaf and bark extracts showed high antioxidant activities as compared to the other crude extracts. This is due to bioactive compounds such as polyphenols including tannins, flavonoid existed in high polar extracts [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B53"">
      53
     </xref>
     ]. Polyphenols are one of the major plant compounds with antioxidant activity. The antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds is reported to be mainly due to their redox properties [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B54"">
      54
     </xref>
     ], which can play an important role in adsorbing and neutralizing free radicals, quenching singlet and triplet oxygen, or decomposing peroxides. Organic extracts may be more beneficial than isolated constituents, because other compounds present in the extracts can change the chemical or biological properties of bioactive individual component [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B55"">
      55
     </xref>
     ].

     Phenolic was also found to be one of the most constituents in both methanol leaf and bark extracts of
     <italic>
      X. longifolium
     </italic>
     . These may be due to the presence of high bioactive compounds as compared to other organic extracts. The key role of phenolic compounds to scavenge free radicals has been emphasized in several reports [

     RP-HPLC analysis is the most widely used method for the identification of plant flavonoid compounds. Because of the diversity and complexity of natural flavonoid in medicinal plants, it is difficult to characterize every compound and elucidate its structure. In
     <italic>
      X. longifolium
     </italic>
     leaf and bark extracts of petroleum ether result the presence of high flavonoids than other extracts. Flavonoid compounds can be defined as a large series of chemical constituents possessing at least one aromatic ring, bearing hydroxyl and other sub-constituents [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B64"">
      64
     </xref>
     ]. Increasingly, flavonoids are becoming the subject of medical research. They have been reported to possess many useful properties, including anti-inflammatory activity, oestrogenic activity, enzyme inhibition, antimicrobial activity, anti-allergic activity, antioxidant activity, vascular activity and cytotoxic anti-tumour activity [

     -
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B71"">
      71
     </xref>
     ]. For centuries, preparations that contain flavonoids as the principal physiologically active constituents, have been used by physicians and lay healers, in attempts to treat human diseases [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B65"">
      65
     </xref>
     ]. Owing to the widespread ability of flavonoids to inhibit spore germination of plant pathogens, they have been proposed for use against fungal pathogens in man [

     Natural products may constitute an appropriate source of anti-infective agents. For example, flavonoids showed antimicrobial activity [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B69"">
      69
     </xref>
     ]. In fact, rutin displayed various biological activities that are beneficial to human health [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B72"">
      72
     </xref>
     ]. Studies showed that rutin give high positive correlation with DPPH in bark extracts. This is in agreement with previous study [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B73"">

     </xref>
     ] which reported that the antimicrobial spectrums of the catechins. Catechin is the most represented individual flavonoid in all extracts and is best extracted by petroleum ether. The higher concentration is found in leaf.

     There is a constant striving to develop safe and new natural antifungal agent to cure the fungal disorders of the increasing social and health implications, where the dermatophytes estimated lifetime risk of acquiring infection. Methods for less deleterious side effects of treatments include use of natural antifungal agents from essential oils and extracts than synthetic drugs [

     In general, extracts derived from plants are considered as non-phytotoxic compounds and potentially effective against several microorganisms including many fungal and bacterial pathogens [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B75"">

     </xref>
     ,
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B76"">
      76
     </xref>
     ]. Since ancient times, interest have been given on the development of safer antifungal agents to control severe fungal diseases by the extracts and essential oils [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B76"">
      76
     </xref>
     -
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B78"">
      78
     </xref>
     ]. The results of the antifungal screening showed that the methanol leaf extract of
     <italic>
      X. longifolium
     </italic>
     have potential anti-dermatophytic activity against some of the skin fungal pathogens. This might be due to the presence of several bioactive compounds in extract of
     <italic>
      X. longifolium
     </italic>
     as evident by the finding of others [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B20"">

     ]. Globally, the anti-dermatophytic activities of all the extracts are very low and seem not to be directly link to their total phenol and individual flavonoids contents. Besides, millions of people throughout the world are affected by superficial fungal infections, which are the most common skin diseases. These infections, which occur in both healthy and immune persons, are caused mainly by dermatophytes. In this study, it was observed that both leaves and barks methanol extracts of
     <italic>
      X. longifolium
     </italic>
     have great potential to inhibit the

     Antimicrobial activities observed in this study might be due to the presence of flavonoid compounds or various other bioactive compounds. Extracts from various medicinal plants containing phenolic and flavonoids compounds have been previously reported to possess antimicrobial activity [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B80"">

     </xref>
     ,
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B81"">

     ]. The properties of gallic, caffeic acids, vanillic acid, rutin, and quercetin of different wine were investigated against pathogenic microorganisms [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B82"">
      82
     </xref>
     ]. The presence of these compounds might contribute to antimicrobial activity [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B20"">

     ,
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B22"">

     ,
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B77"">
      77
     </xref>
     ]. The flavonoid compounds have antimicrobial activity against human pathogenic microorganisms with some mechanisms of action such as inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis, cytoplasmic membrane function and energy metabolisms. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts of
     <italic>
      X. longifolium
     </italic>
     might be due to one of such mechanisms of action mentioned above.
    </p>
    <p>
     The results of this study suggested that
     <italic>
      X. longifolium
     </italic>
     extracts can be used against many tinea infections such as
     <italic>
      Epidermophyton

     sp.,
     <italic>
      Microsporum
     </italic>
     sp. and
     <italic>
      Trichophyton
     </italic>
     sp. where the pathogens have developed resistance against the specific fungicides [

     ,
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B84"">

    <p>
     The results of our study may partially justify the folkloric uses of this plant in traditional medicine and further provide an evidence that the leaf extract of
     <italic>
      Xylosma longifolium
     </italic>
     might be indeed a potential sources of antimicrobial agents as well as natural antioxidants. Further studies are required to isolate and characterize the bioactive molecules present in organic extracts of
     <italic>
      X. longifolium
     </italic>
     to evaluate proper action mechanism of the observed activities.

      Background
     </title>
     <p>
      The economic and biological implications of plant invasion are overwhelming; however, the processes by which plants become successful invaders are not well understood. Limited genetic resources are available for most invasive and weedy species, making it difficult to study molecular and genetic aspects that may be associated with invasion.

      Results
     </title>
     <p>
      As an initial step towards understanding the molecular mechanisms by which plants become invasive, we have generated a normalized Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) library comprising seven invasive populations of
      <italic>
       Centaurea maculosa
      </italic>
      , an invasive aster in North America. Seventy-seven percent of the 4423 unique transcripts showed significant similarity to existing proteins in the NCBI database and could be grouped based on gene ontology assignments.

      Conclusion

     <p>
      The
      <italic>
       C. maculosa
      </italic>
      EST library represents an initial step towards looking at gene-specific expression in this species, and will pave the way for creation of other resources such as microarray chips that can help provide a view of global gene expression in invasive
      <italic>
       C. maculosa
      </italic>
      and its native counterparts. To our knowledge, this is the first published set of ESTs derived from an invasive weed that will be targeted to study invasive behavior. Understanding the genetic basis of evolution for increased invasiveness in exotic plants is critical to understanding the mechanisms through which exotic invasions occur.

     Background
    </title>
    <p>
     Invasive weeds are regarded as major threats to biodiversity because they can spread through communities, displacing or even eradicating native species. Over 25,000 invasive plant species have been documented in the United States, invading nearly 700,000 hectares per year, with a cost exceeding 34.5 billion dollars per year [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B1"">

     </xref>
     ]. Multiple non-exclusive ecological hypotheses exist to explain plant invasion in new habitats [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B2"">
      2
     </xref>
     ]. The niche hypothesis suggests invaders are able to take advantage of unutilized resources in new environments [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B3"">
      3
     </xref>
     ]. The natural enemy release hypothesis suggests invaders escape their natural enemies when moving to new environments, allowing them to obtain high population densities [

     ]. The novel weapons hypothesis suggests that invaders come equipped with an arsenal of chemical weapons that are detrimental to the resident community of the invaded habitat [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B5"">
      5
     </xref>
     ]. The plant community in the invader's native habitat has had time to co-evolve defenses against these chemical weapons, whereas the invaded community has not, allowing invaders to obtain a competitive advantage in their new environment [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B5"">
      5
     </xref>
     ]. The evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis expands on the idea of natural enemy release, suggesting that invaders have rapidly evolved in their new environment to direct more resources to competitive ability over defense [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B6"">
      6
     </xref>
     ]. Similarly, the allelopathic advantages against resident species (AARS) hypothesis expands on the idea of novel weapons, suggesting that novel weapons which increase plant competitive ability are selected for in the invasive range [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B7"">
      7
     </xref>
     ]. All these hypotheses are supported at least in part by data from field experiments which are often coupled with physiological and biochemical studies; however, it remains unclear why some plants become problematic invaders and others do not. One aspect that is rarely investigated in relation to invasive weeds and their native counterparts is the potential for modified gene regulation in the introduced range. As limited genetic resources are available for most invaders and other weedy species [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B8"">
      8
     </xref>
     ], defense and growth response genes cannot be effectively monitored at the molecular level to test hypotheses of plant invasion.

     Lam. (spotted knapweed) is a Eurasian native that has become a particularly problematic invasive weed in the northwestern United States, infesting over 4.5 million acres in Montana alone [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B9"">
      9
     </xref>
     ]. Spotted knapweed often colonizes disturbed areas in North America, but also invades rangelands, pastures and prairies, where it displaces native species and establishes dense monocultures. Diploid and tetraploid forms of the weed exist in the native range, but only tetraploid plants have been identified in North America [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B10"">
      10
     </xref>
     ]. The diploid form contains 18 chromosomes [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B11"">
      11
     </xref>
     ], with a DNA content (2C) near 3.6 picograms based on measures from closely related species of the same chromosome number [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B12"">
      12
     </xref>
     ]. This translates to an estimated genome size of approximately 1,800 Mbp. Molecular markers and karyotyping have been used to identify the two forms, as it is impossible to distinguish between them based on morphological characters [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B10"">
      10
     </xref>
     ]. Both forms are short-lived outcrossing perennials of the aster family; however, the diploid is monocarpic while the tetraploid is polycarpic. Also, the tetraploid can tolerate dense vegetation and thus may be a better competitor than the diploid. This is presumed to be the main reason why only the tetraploid form is invasive in North America, while it is not considered invasive or even predominant in its native Eurasian habitat [
     <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B10"">
      10
     </xref>
     ]. Ecological and greenhouse investigations suggest that invasive

     ]. Also, common garden studies suggest that North American
     <italic>

     seeds germinate more readily than their Eurasian counterparts and the resulting individuals are larger, more robust, and better able to fend off and compensate for herbivore attack, under both greenhouse and field conditions [Ridenour

      Lam were grown for one to two months, at which time two to three entire plants per population were harvested. Tissue was frozen in liquid nitrogen and shipped to Agencourt biosciences for normalized cDNA library construction. Single pass directional sequencing was performed on 4969 randomly selected clones from the

      </xref>
      ].
     </p>
     <p>
      The library consisted of 894 contig-forming ESTs which created 348 unigenes and 4075 singlet ESTs, each representing a unique sequence. Of the 348 unigene contigs, the majority contained only two EST sequences [see Additional File
      <xref ref-type=""supplementary-material"" rid=""S1"">
       1
      </xref>
      ]. The largest unigene contig, which had high similarity to a chlorophyll a-b binding protein, contained 17 ESTs. Interestingly, the second largest unigene contig, a compilation of ten sequences, had extremely low similarity to known sequences and was not able to be annotated. Other large unigene contigs were annotated as polyphenol (catechol) oxidase, chloroplast ATP synthase, photosystem I subunits II and XI, polygalacturonase (a pectinase), and the small subunit of RUBISCO. Normalization should remove most redundant transcripts and enrich for low abundant regulatory genes in the library. However, it is interesting that one of the most abundant transcripts found, polyphenol oxidase, is a potential defense-related protein [
      <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B20"">
       20
      </xref>
      ]. Overall redundancy of the library was 18% (number of clustered ESTs/total ESTs) which suggests that the normalization process was effective, and that continued sequencing of the library has the potential to uncover many more unique transcripts. Sequence quality was high; over 80% of the unigenes were between 800–1100 bp in length [see Additional File
      <xref ref-type=""supplementary-material"" rid=""S2"">

      To annotate the

      or less). Of the entire unigene set, 77% (3392) had significant similarity to genes in the NCBI database, while the remaining 1031 sequences had low similarity and were not able to be annotated. In the group of annotated sequences, 35% (1177 unigenes) had top BLAST hits to transcripts from

      cultivars. Taxonomically, 64% (2182) of the annotated unigene top hits grouped into the rosids clade (which includes the families Brassicacea and Fabaceae), 20.6% grouped into the asterids clade (which includes the families Asteraceae and Solanacea), and 11.8% grouped into the commelinids clade (which includes members of the Poaceae family and other monocots) [see Additional File

      Functional categorization of Centaurea unigenes
     </title>
     <p>
      Gene ontology (GO) assignment programs were used to functionally categorize unigenes in the library. Unigene GO terms were counted and grouped in a hierarchical fashion into the major GO functional categories of Cellular Component, Biological Process and Molecular Function. The GO categories of cellular component and biological process contained over 3000
      <italic>
       Centaurea
      </italic>
      unigene annotations, whereas the molecular function category contained only 2162 annotations. Each category contained approximately 16% unigenes that were annotated as ""unknown,"" but this number does not account for the unigenes that were unable to be annotated in GO format (Figure
      <xref ref-type=""fig"" rid=""F1"">
       1
      </xref>
      ).
     </p>
     <p>
      Approximately 38% of the unigene annotations were grouped into the 'physiological process' category of the Biological Process GO (Figure
      <xref ref-type=""fig"" rid=""F1"">
       1
      </xref>
      ), which includes subcategories such as metabolism, transport, photosynthesis, apoptosis, and homeostasis. The next largest category of unigene annotations (~34%), 'cellular process,' has some overlap of subcategories with physiological processes (i.e., metabolism, transport), but includes unique subcategories such as cell communication, recognition, and differentiation. Five percent of unigene annotations fell in the 'stimulus response' category which includes subcategories that relate to plant response to abiotic and biotic stresses, such as pathogen attack. Thirty unigenes were subcategorized as responding to hormone stimulus, and most of these fell into the ethylene and jasmonic acid signaling pathways. Ethylene- and jasmonic acid-mediated pathways have been implicated in the defense of plants against pathogens and insects [
      <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B21"">
       21
      </xref>
      ,
      <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B22"">

      ], and these transcripts may be up-regulated in
      <italic>
       C. maculosa
      </italic>
      under biotic stress conditions. Only a small percentage of unigene annotations fell into the reproduction category of biological processes (0.3%), but this is not entirely surprising, as reproductive structures such as flowers were not used in the starting material for the library.
     </p>
     <p>
      Over 38% (829) of the unigene annotations fell into the 'catalytic activity' category of the molecular function GO (Figure
      <xref ref-type=""fig"" rid=""F1"">
       1
      </xref>
      ). Specific catalytic activities associated with these unigenes covered a range of GOs, with the largest amount of unigenes falling into the transferase and hydrolase categories (282 and 266 unigenes, respectively). These types of enzymes are involved in many intracellular processes including primary and secondary metabolism, signal transduction, and post translational modification of proteins. The next largest category under molecular function was 'binding' (~27%, 580 unigenes) with the majority of unigenes being associated with nucleotide/nucleic acid binding (134 and 230 unigenes, respectively).
     </p>
     <p>
      Transporters accounted for nearly 8% of all unigene annotations, the majority being ion transporters and transporters with carrier activity (54 and 48 unigenes). Eighteen unigenes fell into the 'ATP-ase coupled transporter' category, which includes transporters of xenobiotics, steroids, sugars, peptides and other small molecules. However, most unigenes could not be subcategorized with a specific transport role. Uptake and translocation of nutrients in plants differ, and regulated expression of specific transporters may allow increased competitive ability in different situations (e.g., increased expression of metal transporters may be beneficial in metal-limiting environments) [

      -
      <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B25"">

      </xref>
      ]. Depending on the specific transporter, these genes could be interesting targets for understanding root exudation or other release strategies for
      <italic>
       Centaurea
      </italic>
      secondary metabolites and uptake of nutrients, and may aid in understanding the role of transport in competitive ability of
      <italic>
       Centaurea
      </italic>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      One hundred twenty-seven unigene annotations were designated as transcriptional regulators, with the majority (118) being subcategorized as having 'transcription factor activity.' Transcription factors are responsible for modulating cellular responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli [
      <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B26"">
       26
      </xref>
      ], and they may play important roles in plant invasion by up- or down-regulating the expression of genes involved in defense and growth responses. Transcription factors identified in the
      <italic>
       Centaurea
      </italic>
      library made up ~6% of the GO annotations for molecular function, whereas ~4% of the
      <italic>
       Arabidopsis
      </italic>
      genome sequences are annotated as transcription factors (The
      <italic>

     </p>
     <p>
      Over two-thirds of the unigenes were localized by cellular component to either cell or organelle, as shown in Figure
      <xref ref-type=""fig"" rid=""F1"">
       1
      </xref>
      . Of these, 164 unigenes were assigned to the nucleus, 357 to the mitochondrion, 52 to the chloroplast, and 37 to the cytosol. Thirty-five unigenes were assigned to the cell wall category and 290 unigenes were assigned to the membrane category, although only 27 could be further categorized to the plasma membrane. These membrane proteins may be interesting targets to investigate transport and/or signal transduction.

      A wide variety of functional categories were represented in the

GPP can then be extended further to FPP, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), and ultimately to dolichol phosphate, a polyprenoid involved in the formation of glycoproteins via the endomembrane system. Two unigenes were annotated as dehydrodolichol phosphate synthases by GO annotation.

        <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B47"">
         47
        </xref>
        ]. The early steps of the pathway involve the generation of phenylpropanoid monomers which are condensed with three malonyl CoA units to form the chalcones, followed by isomerization, hydroxylation, methylation, glycosylation, and polymerizations steps [
        <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B46"">
         46

However, no unigenes showed significant sequence similarity to flavonol synthase (FLS), the gene responsible for generation of the flavonols, or flavone synthase (FS), the gene product of which converts flavanones to flavones. Each of these genes are oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, and several unigenes suggest this function, as revealed by GO annotation. Further, only two FS clones from Asteraceae members (

       Defense-response genes

        5

       </italic>
       sequence information it will be possible to test levels of basal defense responses at the level of gene expression in populations of native and invasive plants. Genes involved only in induced defense response may be under represented in the library, as the plants that were used in library creation did not undergo interspecific competition, pathogen stress, or herbivory and were not grown under field conditions. However, many of the unigenes identified have been implicated in induced defenses in other systems (PR-1 and EDS-like unigenes), and these may be good candidates for studying induced as well as basal defense response. Future experiments can be coupled with more traditional tests of morphology and biochemistry in order to supplement data concerning hypotheses of plant invasion.

      Seeds from seven invasive populations of

      </italic>
      Lam were obtained from Ray Callaway (University of Montana, Missoula). Five populations originated from Montana, one from Washington, and one from Virginia. Six seeds from each of the seven populations were sterilized by heating at 50°C for ten minutes in distilled water. Seeds were cooled to ambient temperature, rinsed with sterile water and placed in Petri dishes containing moist germination paper. Plates were wrapped in parafilm and placed in a growth chamber with a photoperiod of 20 hours light/six hours dark at a constant temperature of 25°C. Upon the emergence of cotyledons, seedlings were planted in 2.5 cm pots in a mix of 70% sand, 10% perlite, and 20% autoclaved potting soil and transported to the greenhouse. Pots were placed in a flat and covered with plastic wrap for approximately one week until seedlings became established. Plants were given sufficient water and fertilized once per week with a dilute solution of Miracle Gro (Maryville, OH). After approximately two months, two to three plants per population were removed from pots and their roots were washed to remove soil particles. All plants were in the form of small rosettes, lacking stem and floral tissue. Entire plants, including roots, were wrapped in foil, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until processing.

      Plant tissue was shipped in dry ice to Agencourt Bioscience Corporation (Beverly MA). Total RNA was extracted and optimized first strand cDNA synthesis was performed using a primer adapted with a rare enzyme cut site. cDNA fragments were size-selected by agarose gel electrophoresis, and directionally cloned into a pAGEN-1 vector. A positive control containing the Tet

Single-stranded DNA was made from a portion of the primary library by phagemid production, and reactions were treated with DNase I to ensure the removal of double-stranded DNA. A second portion of the primary library was linearized and transcribed into anti-sense RNA with biotinylated dNTPs. Oligo dT and primer extension were used to pre-block the poly-A region prior to hybridization. The anti-sense RNA and single-stranded circular DNA were hybridized, and abundant clones were removed using streptavidin. To reduce the amount of empty vectors, a Not1 oligo and

     <p>
      The normalized library was plated and 4969 clones were randomly selected for sequencing. Automated plasmid purification was achieved using the SPRI (SprintPrep™) technique, which harvests plasmid DNA directly from lysed bacterial cultures, trapping both plasmid and genomic DNA to functionalized bead particles and selectively eluting only the plasmid (Beckman Biomek FX robots and CCS Packard DNATraks).

      To determine the number of unique transcripts in the library, an in-house pipeline program was used to cluster and assemble the trimmed EST sequences. The pipeline essentially utilizes TIGR Assembler with its default parameters (overlap of at least 40 bp with 94% identity). The PLAN web system (Personal BLAST Navigator, Noble foundation) was used to do a BLASTX search against the non-redundant protein (NR) database for functional annotation, and gene ontology (GO) sequence database for functional categorization [

      or less) and top hits from GO assignment were deposited in PLAN and can be searched by keyword or unigene accession number (PLAN Project 30060, CENT_UG_00001-CENT_UG_04423). GO annotation was used to categorize unigenes into functional categories by molecular function, cellular component and biological process. A customized in-house program was used to count the number of unigenes being grouped under different GO term categories in a hierarchical fashion [

        <p>
         The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, tolerability, and food effect of cenerimod, a potent sphingosine-1-phosphate subtype 1 receptor modulator, were investigated in three sub-studies. Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised studies in healthy male subjects were performed. Cenerimod was administered either as single dose (1, 3, 10 or 25 mg; Study 1) or once daily for 35 days (0.5, 1, 2 or 4 mg; Study 2). A two-period cross-over, open-label study was performed to assess the food effect (1 mg, Study 3). The pharmacokinetic profile of cenerimod was characterised by a

         of 5.0–6.2 h. Terminal half-life after single and multiple doses ranged from 170 to 199 h and 283 to 539 h, respectively. Food had no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of cenerimod. A dose-dependent decrease in lymphocyte count was observed after initiation of cenerimod and reached a plateau (maximum change from baseline: −64%) after 20–23 days of treatment. Lymphocyte counts returned to baseline values at end-of-study examination. One serious adverse event of circulatory collapse (25 mg dose group, maximum tolerated dose: 10 mg) and adverse events of mild-to-moderate intensity were reported. Treatment initiation was associated with transient decreases in heart rate and blood pressure at doses &gt;1 and ≥10 mg, respectively.

       ]. In animal species and man, the binding of cenerimod to plasma proteins is &gt;99.9%. In rats and dogs, single- and multiple-dose administration of cenerimod at doses &gt;0.3 mg/kg induced a dose-dependent and reversible reduction of lymphocyte count. In a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis), preventive and therapeutic treatment with cenerimod (6 mg/kg/day) led to clinical and histological efficacy. In rats, a decrease in HR was observed at doses ≥0.3 mg/kg, this reduction was similar at doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of cenerimod (0.1 mg/kg) revealed a rapid absorption and a terminal half-life (

       The aim of the studies reported here was to assess for the first time in humans the PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), food effect (only after single dose), safety, and tolerability of cenerimod as a single oral dose or once daily (o.d.) multiple oral doses for 35 days.

Most of the observed AEs were considered unrelated to study drug. The serious adverse event defined the maximum tolerated single dose of 10 mg.

       This study provides the first PK, PD, safety, and tolerability data for cenerimod, a selective oral S1P

The nature and severity of AEs reported in the present studies were similar to those observed following administration of other representatives of this drug class, e.g., ponesimod [

       Pharmacokinetic evaluation revealed that exposure to cenerimod was slightly more than dose-proportional for single doses and dose-proportional across the entire dose range for multiple doses. The intersubject variability was low to moderate for

       As expected, based on its pharmacological mode of action, cenerimod decreased the lymphocyte count in peripheral blood. Following single-dose administration, this reduction was different from placebo at doses ≥3 mg and was dose-dependent. Single- and multiple-dose administration of 25 and 2 mg led to a maximal decrease of circulating lymphocytes of 76% and 64%, respectively. This is in good agreement with previous data obtained from fingolimod and ponesimod administered at supra-therapeutic doses [

The health of the subjects was assessed at the screening visit, which included recording of the medical history, medications taken during the 3 months preceding the screening visit, a physical examination, measurement of body weight and height, clinical laboratory tests, recording of vital signs, and standard electrocardiogram (ECG). At screening, subjects had to have PR interval &lt;200 ms, HR 55–90 bpm, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) 100–150 and 50–90 mm Hg, respectively, (FEV

Written informed consent was obtained from each individual participating in the study prior to any study procedure and after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, objectives and potential hazards of the studies. The single-ascending dose study (Study 1) was performed prior to and in a different centre than the multiple-ascending dose (Study 2) and the food effect study (Study 3). All protocols were approved by the Reading and Plymouth Independent Ethics Committees (UK) (date of approval of initial protocol from Institutional Review Board (IRB), 10 November 2010 for SAD, 20 April 2012 for MAD and food effect). These studies were performed according to good clinical practice and in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

        This work was performed in two centres located in the UK. Study 1 and Study 2 were single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group single- and multiple-ascending oral dose studies, respectively. Study 3 was a two-way cross-over, open-label, food effect study. A total of 72 male subjects (32, 32 and 8 subjects in Study 1, Study 2 and Study 3, respectively) were enrolled, 8 subjects were assigned per dose group (ratio 3:1 for active:placebo in Study 1 and Study 2). Female subjects were excluded based on the potential teratogenic risk of cenerimod. Cenerimod (capsule formulation) was administered at a single dose of 1, 3, 10 or 25 mg in Study 1 and o.d. for 35 days at doses of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mg in Study 2. In Study 3, a single dose of 1 mg cenerimod was administered either in fed (i.e., a high-fat and high-calorie (as described in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance [

All treatments were administered in the morning (fasted condition in Study 1 and Study 2) with approximately 240 mL of water. Based on the ratio of the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-levels in the 4-week rat and dog toxicology studies and human equivalent doses at the planned starting dose of 1 mg, the safety margins were 33.8 and 116.8, respectively. PK and PD profiles after multiple oral o.d. doses were predicted from data obtained during Study 1 and supported the selection of doses in Study 2.

After centrifugation, plasma was transferred into a polypropylene tube and stored at −21 °C (±5 °C) pending analysis. Plasma concentrations of cenerimod were determined using a validated liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry assay with a lower limit of quantification of 0.1 ng/mL and using a pentadeuterated form of cenerimod as internal standard. The method was linear in the concentration range 0.1–100 ng/mL. Analysis of quality-control samples of all runs showed that inter-batch coefficients of variation (precision) were &lt;8.8%, whereas the average intra-batch accuracy was in the range 96.0–102.7%. Noncompartmental PK analyses were performed using Professional WinNonlin 6.1 software (Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, CA, USA). The variables

       </title>
       <p>
        Analysis of the lymphocyte count in peripheral blood was performed at the same time points as PK samples in Study 1 and Study 3. In Study 2, lymphocyte count was assessed on Day 1, every 3 days from Day 2 to Day 35, and at each outpatient visit. Assessment of lymphocyte count was part of the clinical haematology evaluation. To assess lymphocyte count, blood samples of 2.7 mL were collected into a K

       <p>
        Safety and tolerability were evaluated by monitoring AEs, vital signs measurements (supine BP), 12-lead ECG recordings, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), clinical laboratory, physical, and neurological examinations. ECG variables and BP were recorded pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.5, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 144 h after study drug administration in Study 1. For the single-dose groups of 10 and 25 mg in Study 1 and for Study 3, study day 14, 21 and 28 time points were added. In Study 2, recordings of BP and 12-lead ECG were performed pre-dose and 1, 2.5, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 h post-dose on Day 1 and pre-dose and 4, 6, 8, 12 h post-dose from Day 2 to Day 35. Additional recordings were done at each outpatient visit.

                <p>
                 Prolonged exposure to hyperoxia in neonates can cause hyperoxic acute lung injury (HALI), which is characterized by increased pulmonary permeability and diffuse infiltration of various inflammatory cells. Disruption of the epithelial barrier may lead to altered pulmonary permeability and maintenance of barrier properties requires intact epithelial tight junctions (TJs). However, in neonatal animals, relatively little is known about how the TJ proteins are expressed in the pulmonary epithelium, including whether expression of TJ proteins is regulated in response to hyperoxia exposure. This study determines whether changes in tight junctions play an important role in disruption of the pulmonary epithelial barrier during hyperoxic acute lung injury.

                 Newborn rats, randomly divided into two groups, were exposed to hyperoxia (95% oxygen) or normoxia for 1–7 days, and the severity of lung injury was assessed; location and expression of key tight junction protein occludin and ZO-1 were examined by immunofluorescence staining and immunobloting; messenger RNA in lung tissue was studied by RT-PCR; transmission electron microscopy study was performed for the detection of tight junction morphology.

                <p>
                 We found that different durations of hyperoxia exposure caused different degrees of lung injury in newborn rats. Treatment with hyperoxia for prolonged duration contributed to more serious lung injury, which was characterized by increased wet-to-dry ratio, extravascular lung water content, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF):serum FD4 ratio. Transmission electron microscopy study demonstrated that hyperoxia destroyed the structure of tight junctions and prolonged hyperoxia exposure, enhancing the structure destruction. The results were compatible with pathohistologic findings. We found that hyperoxia markedly disrupted the membrane localization and downregulated the cytoplasm expression of the key tight junction proteins occludin and ZO-1 in the alveolar epithelium by immunofluorescence. The changes of messenger RNA and protein expression of occludin and ZO-1 in lung tissue detected by RT-PCR and immunoblotting were consistent with the degree of lung injury.

                <p>
                 These data suggest that the disruption of the pulmonary epithelial barrier induced by hyperoxia is, at least in part, due to massive deterioration in the expression and localization of key TJ proteins.

              Therapy with a high concentration of oxygen (hyperoxia) is often necessary to treat neonates with respiratory failure in neonatal intensive care units. However, one of the main complications is hyperoxia-induced lung injury, which may later result in serious sequela, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) [

               2
              </xref>
              ]. The neonates with BPD continue to show decreased lung capacity at school age and even as young adolescents [
              <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B3"">
               3

               5
              </xref>
              ]. BPD has a negative impact not only on short-term and long-term pulmonary function but also on overall growth and neurodevelopment of these infants [
              <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""B6"">
               6

               7
              </xref>
              ]. However, the mechanism of hyperoxia-induced lung injury is still not completely understood and currently there are no evidence-based effective strategies to prevent or treat this disease. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand how hyperoxia exposure initially influences pulmonary structure and function and how this lastingly disrupts lung development.

              It is well known that the major pathologic finding associated with hyperoxia exposure at the early stage is hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury, which is frequently accompanied by an inflammatory response within lungs [

              ]. This response is characterized by increased pulmonary permeability and diffuse infiltration of various inflammatory cells [

             <p>
              The permeability barrier in terminal airspaces of the lung is due in large part to tight junctions between alveolar epithelial cells, which are continuous, circumferential, belt-like structures and regulate the flow of molecules between apical and basolateral compartments [

              ]. Tight junction is a primary barrier that regulates the diffusion of solutes through the paracellular pathway. Occludin and zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) are two well characterized proteins in tight junctions. Occludin is a transmembrane protein which provides most of the barrier function of the tight junction [

               18

              ]. Zonula occludens 1 is an intracellular protein, located between occludin and cytoskeletal proteins and thought to affect paracellular permeability [

              ]. Occludin and ZO-1 proteins form the intact intercellular barrier at tight junctions, and differences in the expression of these key TJ proteins account for differences in barrier function and paracellular permeability among epithelia [

              However, our current understanding of the structural components and regulation of tight junctions in the alveolar epithelium is insufficient, and previous studies were mainly performed in adult animals or cells and have scarcely been examined in the neonatal period. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether there were changes in alveolar barrier structure and function in newborn rats exposed to hyperoxia and whether tight junction proteins were differentially expressed in the lung during experimental acute lung injury induced by hyperoxia and whether these changes account for impairment in alveolar barrier properties and are relevant to pulmonary edema formation.

               Time-dated, pregnant Wistar rats (200–220 g) were purchased from the Center for Experimental Animals of China Medical University. All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the Laboratory Animal Ethics Committee of China Medical University. Pups were delivered naturally at term gestation (22 days). The full-term newborn rats from twelve litters were randomly marked and assigned to two groups and were exposed to hyperoxia (95% oxygen; experimental group) or normoxia (21%; control group) beginning on the day of birth. The inhaled oxygen concentration was measured and recorded continuously with an analyzer equipped with a strip-chart recorder (model 572; Servomex, Norwood, MA). Humidity was routinely 60%–70%. Nursing rat dams were switched every 24 hours between the hyperoxic and normoxic chambers, to avoid oxygen toxicity and provide equal nutrition to each litter. Chambers were open for 10 min per day for weighing and cage cleaning. Pups were sacrificed and lungs were harvested at the end of 1, 3, 5 and 7 days of exposure.

Fifteen minutes later, the trachea was exposed, and the lungs were lavaged three times with 1 ml of sterile saline per wash. The aliquots of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected. Blood was obtained by cardiac puncture, and the serum was collected by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min. The concentrations of FD4 in the BALF and serum (20 fold diluted by PBS) were determined with a spectrofluorometer (F-4500; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) using an excitation filter of 492 nm and an emission wavelength of 515 nm. The BALF:serum fluorescence ratio was calculated and used as a measure of pulmonary epithelial permeability.

               Briefly, equal amounts of protein extract were mixed in 1 × Laemmli buffer and boiled for 3 min. The proteins were electrophoresed on 7.5% precast SDS-polyacrylamide gels (80 V for 120 min). Then the proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (40 V for 180 min). The membranes were incubated for 1 h in 1:10 normal donkey serum to block nonspecific binding. The PVDF membranes were then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies occludin (1:500), ZO-1 (1:250), and β-actin (1:4,000) diluted in PBS-0.02% Tween 20. Some samples were incubated in the solution without primary antibodies to be negative controls. After washing three times in PBS, the membranes were incubated at room temperature for 90 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The membrane was then washesd in PBS and impregnated with the enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (ECL kit; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and was used to expose the radiograhic film. All the bands were scanned with ChemiImager 5500 V2.03 software, and IDVs were calculated by computerized image analysis system (Fluor Chen 2.0) and normalized to that of β-actin.

               Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung tissues from newborn rats after different days of hyperoxia or normoxia exposure were treated with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. On the first day, the alveolar-like structures in full-term newborn rat lungs exposed to normoxia were irregular, and a small number of septa could be seen (Figure

                1

               F). The alveoli were regular and uniformly distributed in newborn rats exposed to normoxia on the seventh day (Figure

                1

               G). In the hyperoxia group, there was increased loss of pulmonary epithelial architecture, more inflammatory cells and red blood cell infiltration in the alveolar space with proteinaceous debris filling the airspaces on day 7 (Figure

               H). After 7 days of hyperoxia, the lung injury appeared more severe than that observed on day 3 or day 5. Treatment with hyperoxia for 3 days resulted in a less severe injury to lung tissue compared with that observed on day 5. The observation demonstrated that more severe lung injury happened in newborn rats with longer hyperoxia exposure. Lung injury scores, shown in Figure

              <p>
               Pulmonary edema formation, indicative of injury to the pulmonary epithelial barrier, often happens with an increase in the total water W/D ratio. Our study revealed there was no difference in W/D ratio between the normoxia group and the hyperoxia group on the first day (

               The measurement of extravascular lung water content is also valuable in studies of mechanisms of increased permeability pulmonary edema. The extravascular lung water content in newborn rats with hyperoxia exposure was higher than that with normoxia exposure and the results were almost the same with the lung W/D ratio (Figure

               Hyperoxia exposure decreases pulmonary epithelial barrier function
              </title>
              <p>
               Generally, pulmonary epithelial barrier function decreases with an increase of bronchoalveolar epithelial permeability. We monitored the changes in pulmonary epithelial barrier function by examining the effect of hyperoxia exposure on bronchoalveolar epithelial permeability. Bronchoalveolar epithelial permeability was determined by measuring the leakage of FD4 from serum into BALF in rats (Figure
               <xref ref-type=""fig"" rid=""F3"">
                3
               </xref>
               ). On the first day, there was no obvious difference in the BALF:serum fluorescence ratios between the hyperoxia and normoxia groups (

                P

               Morphological alterations of tight junction in alveolar epithelia during hyperoxia exposure
              </title>
              <p>
               Since hyperoxia exposure increased the bronchoalveolar epithelial permeability in newborn rats, it might alter the morphology of tight junction in the alveolar epithelium. The integrity of pulmonary epithelium and morphological alterations of tight junction were studied by transmission electron microscopy in newborn rats with normoxia and hyperoxia exposure. Random sampling of left lung from newborn rats exposed to normoxia showed obvious and frequent junctions between all epithelial cells which were extremely tight (Figure
               <xref ref-type=""fig"" rid=""F4"">
                4
               </xref>
               A). The tight junctions were ultrastructurally normal (Figure

                4
               </xref>
               B). In contrast, after treatment with hyperoxia for 7 days, random sampling of left lungs from newborn rats showed loss of tight junctions between alveolar epithelial cells (Figure
               <xref ref-type=""fig"" rid=""F4"">
                4
               </xref>
               C). The tight junctions were irregularly widened (Figure

                4
               </xref>
               D). Epithelial cells appeared retracted from each other with clear paracellular gaps. After 5 days of hyperoxia exposure, the tight junctions were also widened but to a much less extent (Figure

                 The integrity of pulmonary epithelium and morphological alterations of tight junction were studied by transmission electron microscopy in both normoxia and hyperoxia groups. Tight junctions between pulmonary epithelial cells were extremely tight in the lungs from normoxia-treated newborn rats (

               Effects of hyperoxia exposure on the localization and expression of ZO-1 and occludin in alveolar epithelia
              </title>
              <p>
               The morphology of tight junctions in the alveolar epithelium altered when exposed to hyperoxia. Then the localization and expression of tight junction proteins in the alveolar epithelium might change. ZO-1 and occludin, which are two of the best-characterized tight junction proteins, were examined by immunofluorescence staining from frozen sections of the right middle lobe. ZO-1 was localized in lung tissue from rats with normoxia exposure as a continuous line along the boundaries between neighboring bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells (Figure

               A). Within one day of hyperoxia exposure, ZO-1 distribution in tight junctions was not obviously diminished. After 3 and 5 days, hyperoxia exposure induced partial breakdown of membrane staining and decreased cytoplasm staining of ZO-1 in the alveolar epithelium (Figure
               <xref ref-type=""fig"" rid=""F5"">
                5
               </xref>
               B). Treatment with hyperoxia for 7 days induced a fragmented staining pattern on the membrane (Figure

                5
               </xref>
               C). The features of occludin immunostaining were similar to that of ZO-1. A consecutive line along the membrane and diffuse in the cytoplasm staining of occludin was shown in the alveolar epithelium of control rats (Figure

                5
               </xref>
               D). The intensity of this staining was dramatically reduced in lung tissues from rats which were exposed to hyperoxia for 7 days (Figure

                 Immunostaining and western blot analysis were performed to identify alteration in location and expression of ZO-1 and occludin in alveolar epithelial. A continuous line along the membrane and diffuse in the cytoplasm staining of ZO-1 and occludin was shown in the alveolar epithelium of control rats (A, D). After 3 and 5 days, hyperoxia exposure induced partial breakdown of membrane staining and decreased cytoplasm staining of ZO-1 in the alveolar epithelium (B). The staining intensity of ZO-1 and occludin was dramatically reduced in lung tissues from rats which were exposed to hyperoxia for 7 days (C, E). Bars represent 50 μm. After 7 days of hyperoxia exposure, the expression of ZO-1 and occludin dramatically declined and was virtually undetectable examined by Western blotting. β-actin immunoreactive bands were used to demonstrate equal loading (F, H). Densitometric quantification of ZO-1 and occludin protein levels was expressed as fold increase compared with normoxia for 1 day group (set as 1) (G, I). Values are presented as means ± SD; *

               Furthermore, we detected the protein expression of ZO-1 and occludin from lung tissue by immunoblotting. Hyperoxia exposure can induce different levels of tight junction proteins expression in neonatal rat lung tissue after 1–7 days of duration. The protein expression levels of ZO-1 increased slightly after one day of hyperoxia exposure and clear ZO-1 bands were apparent in both experimental and control group on day 1. However, the decrease of ZO-1 expression was statistically significant after 3 days of hyperoxia exposure (

               The messenger RNA expressions of ZO-1 and occludin were further examined in lung tissue by RT-PCR. The results showed that 1 day of hyperoxia exposure significantly depressed the messenger RNA levels of ZO-1 (

              Although hyperoxia exposure is the most common cause of lung injury for neonates requiring respiratory support, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain elusive. Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and diffuse infiltration of inflammatory cells have been confirmed as the major pathologic findings in hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury [

              ]. Previous studies on mechanisms related to these pathologic changes are mostly focused on abnormal secretion of cytokines, and imbalance between oxidation and antioxidation [

              ]. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms involved in disruption of the pulmonary epithelial barrier itself are seldom investigated in neonatal hyperoxic lung injury and no such research is concerned with how tight junctions change during the disease. Thus, our study was undertaken to explore possible mechanisms of impairment of pulmonary epithelial integrity and find what role tight junctions play in newborn animals with hyperoxia exposure.

              Our study, for the first time, demonstrated alterations in the structure and function of tight junctions in hyperoxia-induced lung injury in newborn animals. We observed that hyperoxia exposure impaired pulmonary epithelial tight junctions with increased pulmonary epithelial permeability in an in vivo model. Also, we found that the expression of occludin and ZO-1 decreased during hyperoxia exposure and the alterations were consistent with changes in the barrier function of the bronchoalveolar epithelium, suggesting these key tight junction proteins might play important roles in the disruption of epithelial integrity in hyperoxic lung injury in newborn rats.

              This study provided new evidence that hyperoxia exposure led to inflammation and pulmonary edema. According to the histologic findings, we confirmed that proteinaceous fluid and neutrophil infiltration in lung tissue markedly increased after hyperoxia exposure. Pulmonary neutrophil sequestration and transmigration are demonstrated as typical manifestations of acute lung injury [

              ]. In this study, the results of lung W/D ratio and extravascular lung water content reached a common consensus that, there was obvious pulmonary edema in newborn rats with prolonged hyperoxia exposure, which were comparable with the severity of changes in pathology. These results are in accordance with previous studies which show polymorphonuclear cell infiltration and edema formation in hyperoxia-induced ALI [

              We also showed that hyperoxia exposure in newborn rats significantly increased bronchoalveolar epithelial permeability (about 2–4 fold). The magnitude of the functional alteration in pulmonary epithelial barrier peaked after 7 days of hyperoxia exposure while the BALF:serum FD4 ratio was almost unchanged on day 1. The data demonstrated treatment with hyperoxia for prolonged duration contributed to more serious lung injury. Our findings are consitent with other studies which show hyperoxia increases pulmonary permeability [

              ], transmission electron microscopy was used in this study to examine their morphological alterations. We observed that treatment with hyperoxia in newborn rats destroyed the structure of tight junctions. Using immunofluorescence, we showed that hyperoxia exposure markedly disrupted the membrane localization and downregulated the cytoplasm expression of the key tight junction proteins occludin and ZO-1 in the alveolar epithelium and the results were confirmed by immunoblotting and RT-PCR. Functional opening of tight junction barrier and down-regulation of occludin and ZO-1 protein expression have been also found in acute lung injury in adult animals [

              Furthermore, our study showed that prolonged hyperoxia exposure enhanced the structure destruction of epithelial tight junctions while decreasing in occludin and ZO-1 expression was more obvious. This temporal pattern of changes in the expression of key tight junction proteins was paralleled by changes in the barrier function of the bronchoalveolar epithelium, which suggested decreased synthesis of occludin and ZO-1 at a transcriptional level may be a mechanism for the rapid disruption of epithelial integrity in newborn animals with hyperoxia-induced lung injury. However, abnormal structure of the tight junction was not found in groups with 1 or 3 days of hyperoxia exposure. Also, pathohistologic findings showed there was no inflammation and protein leakage until the third day of hyperoxia exposure. This phenomenon suggests that mild-to-moderate deterioration of these proteins may not be enough to change the morphology of tight junctions and cause severe lung edema.

              A preliminary study has given some clue that oxidative stress induces tyrosine phosphorylation and dissociates the occludin-ZO-1 complexes from the cytoskeleton by a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism [

             </title>
             <p>
              Taken together, this study demonstrates that hyperoxia exposure in newborn rats impairs the structure and function of alveolar epithelial tight junctions and the changes are enhanced with prolonged hyperoxia exposure. Our data demonstrate occludin and ZO-1 expressions decrease during hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury in neonatal animals and the alterations are consistent with the severity of lung injury. Therefore, we propose that the disruption of the pulmonary epithelial barrier induced by hyperoxia is, at least in part, due to massive deterioration in the expression and localization of key TJ proteins. How deterioration of these proteins impairs the function of pulmonary epithelial barrier needs further study.
