Interestingly, it was recently reported that a liver specific glucagon receptor knockout displays increased α-cell proliferation and hyperplasia similar to what has been previously reported for the global glucagon receptor knockout,  14  and that wild-type islets transplanted under the kidney capsule of glucagon receptor deficient mice or the liver specific knockout likewise increase their α-cell proliferation. This observation—combined with studies from the same group demonstrating that a liver specific INSR knockout displays a large increase in the pancreatic β-cell mass  10  whereas muscle specific INSR knockout has normal glucose metabolism  11  —led the authors to suggest the liver as a possible source of the circulating factor.  1  did not investigate the effect of betatrophin on triglycerides, the consequence of loss-of-function of betatrophin on β-cell mass and glucose homeostasis, or the dependence of the effect on ANGPTL3.  12  The observation that a liver-specific INSR knockout (the LIRKO mouse) results in increased β-cell mass was further studied by the group of Rohit N. Kulkarni: they used a parabiotic model where the circulation of mice is coupled by surgery thus allowing the study of the effect of circulating factors between mice of different genotypes.  1  They developed an elegant pharmacological model of insulin resistance utilizing a peptide insulin receptor antagonist, S961, invented by Lauge Schäffer at Novo Nordisk A/S  17  which induces severe insulin resistance when infused in mice.  13  It was further shown that wild-type islets transplanted into the kidney capsule of LIRKO mice also increased their proliferation rate demonstrating that the effect on proliferation is uncoupled from the vagus innervation of the pancreas in this model.  1  The official name of the gene encoding mouse betatrophin is Gm6484, but it has been annotated a number of times under different names: EG624219  2  ,  3  , RIFL  4  , Lipasin  5  and ANGPTL8.  14  ,  15  These data suggest the existence of a circulating factor induced in glucagon resistant states which can induce α-cell proliferation independent of a vagus nerve signal to the pancreas.    16  However, although these findings are interesting, the receptor for HGF is the protooncogene C-Met, which may pose a problem from a drugability safety point of view.  13  Importantly, it was also shown that serum from LIRKO mice was able to induce specific β-cell replication in wild-type mice by interperitoneal serum injection and that LIRKO serum could increase mouse and human β-cell replication rates in vitro.  13  Together, these data provide compelling evidence for a circulating liver-derived factor in insulin resistant mice that is able to induce proliferation of mouse and human β-cells.  18  To investigate the effect of betatrophin in vivo  ,  expression in the liver was achieved by hydrodynamic tail injection of expression plasmids encoding mouse and human betatrophin.  1  ,  19  They confirm, albeit in a NOD-Scid immunodeficient background, that S961 induced insulin resistance results in a marked increase in hepatic betatrophin expression and an increase in the proliferation of the pancreatic β-cells.

Kulkarni: they used a parabiotic model where the circulation of mice is coupled by surgery thus allowing the study of the effect of circulating factors between mice of different genotypes.  1  They developed an elegant pharmacological model of insulin resistance utilizing a peptide insulin receptor antagonist, S961, invented by Lauge Schäffer at Novo Nordisk A/S  17  which induces severe insulin resistance when infused in mice.  13  It was further shown that wild-type islets transplanted into the kidney capsule of LIRKO mice also increased their proliferation rate demonstrating that the effect on proliferation is uncoupled from the vagus innervation of the pancreas in this model.  1  The official name of the gene encoding mouse betatrophin is Gm6484, but it has been annotated a number of times under different names: EG624219  2  ,  3  , RIFL  4  , Lipasin  5  and ANGPTL8.  14  ,  15  These data suggest the existence of a circulating factor induced in glucagon resistant states which can induce α-cell proliferation independent of a vagus nerve signal to the pancreas.\n",

      " A previously reported effect of betatrophin on regeneration of pancreatic β cells is currently considered to be negative [  4  -  8  ]. The production of betatrophin in the liver is greatly enhanced under insulin resistance caused by the administration of an insulin receptor blocker [  4  ], and therefore it may be theologically possible that the agents which can decrease circulating insulin levels, such as sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors [  14  ], increase circulating betatrophin levels, resulting in the change of serum lipids levels.

Arginine methylation has been shown to generally alter protein function by modulating protein-protein interactions, protein-nucleic acid interactions, and protein trafficking [  11  ,  21  ,  59  ,  60  ]. In eukaryotes, PE can be synthesized by decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine (PS), by head group exchange with PS, by acylation of lyso-PE, or by the CDP-ethanolamine branch of the Kennedy pathway [  65  ,  66  ]. In yeast and mammals, arginine methylation has been associated with a diversity of cellular processes including signal transduction [  5  ,  6  ], RNA transport [  7  ,  8  ] and processing [  9  -  12  ], protein localization [  13  -  15  ], and transcription [  16  ]. In addition to serving as a precursor for triacylglycerol (TAG), DAG is also used to synthesize phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) [  64  ]. In mammalian and yeast cells, the bulk of the PC pool is synthesized by the CDP-choline branch of the Kennedy pathway [  64  ]. In addition, a small fraction of PC is generated by sequential methylation of PE [  64  ].  In T. brucei  , PC is synthesized solely by the CDP-choline branch of the Kennedy pathway, while PE is produced exclusively via the CDP-ethanolamine branch of the Kennedy pathway [  67  ,  69  ,  70  ]. Of great importance is the fact that, as opposed to other parasitic organisms, trypanosomes synthesize phospholipids  de novo  [  68  ]. Disruption of the enzymes of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway by RNA interference have shown that this branch of the Kennedy pathway is essential for both procyclic and bloodstream form  T. brucei  cell growth [  69  ,  71  ]. In  T. brucei  , the pool of PI used for GPI synthesis is supplied from glucose-6-phosphate by the action of PI synthase, an enzyme shown to be essential in both bloodstream and procyclic form trypanosomes [  68  ,  70  ,  71  ]. As for other eukaryotes, PC and PE constitute the majority of phospholipids in trypanosomes [  67  ]. Arginine residues that serve as substrates for PRMTs are usually found within glycine/arginine rich (GAR) domains [  61  -  63  ].\n",

They also used Invitrogen's Superscript II RT and Platinum Taq for RT-PCR, albeit in a two-step cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification procedure [  13  ]. [  13  ] were derived from contaminating MLV RNA and/or DNA.\n",
      "Curiously, one study described PCR detection of a second MLV (modified polytropic MLV), but not XMRV itself, in the blood of some CFS patients [  5  ]. It is striking that there have been no independent reports of patient-derived XMRV integration sites nor have there been any descriptions of polytropic or modified polytropic MLV integration sites in human samples despite the apparent detection of these viruses in CFS patients [\n",
