      "miR-31 expression levels are high in early stage BC tumors, allowing for its pro-invasive, pro-metastatic target genes to remain under tight control [  24  ,  36  ]. In BC mouse models, re-expression of miR-31 in the triple-negative MDA-MB-231 BC cells, which do not express endogenous miR-31, almost completely inhibits the metastatic potential of these cells without affecting the growth of the primary tumors while specifically inhibiting its pro-metastatic target genes ([  36  ] and Sossey-Alaoui, unpublished data). Loss of miR-31 expression is accompanied by concomitant increase in expression of its pro-invasive and pro-metastatic target genes, therefore, allowing for the tumor to become more invasive and ultimately metastasizes [  24  ,  36  ]. On the other hand, knockdown of miR-31 in the non invasive luminal MCF7 BC cells results in lifting the inhibitory effect imposed by miR-31 on its target genes and imparts aggressive and metastatic phenotype to these cells comparable to observed in MDA-MB-231 cells [  24  ,  36  ]. Expression levels of miR-31diminish as the tumors progress to more invasive stages [  24  ] and become undetectable in metastatic BC tumors [  36  ].

As described for previously characterized prion determining regions of yeast proteins [  22  ,  23  ,  28  ,  29  ,  34  ,  40  -  43  ], both the 519Q and 582Q also conferred upon GFP a capacity to exist in distinct states and showed aggregation pattern similar to NM-GFP (Figure  5  A-C and Additional file  2  : Figure S2B).

In BC mouse models, re-expression of miR-31 in the triple-negative MDA-MB-231 BC cells, which do not express endogenous miR-31, almost completely inhibits the metastatic potential of these cells without affecting the growth of the primary tumors while specifically inhibiting its pro-metastatic target genes ([  36  ] and Sossey-Alaoui, unpublished data).

Sequence analysis showed that sequences in both CFS and healthy controls aligned with MLV sequences found in mice and reported in patients with CFS or prostate cancer [  2  ,  19  ,  20  ].
