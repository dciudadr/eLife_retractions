Visfatin was recently described as an adipocytokine with potentially important effects on glucose metabolism and atherosclerosis. Visfatin has been linked to several inflammatory conditions, beta cell function, and cardiovascular disease. The growing number of publications on the subject shall bring further evidence about this adipocytokine. Its findings may contribute in the identification of higher risk individuals for diabetes and cardiovascular disease with a better comprehension about the complex intercorrelation between adiposity, glucose metabolism and vascular disease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The ongoing global epidemic of atherosclerotic disease is propelled by a concurrent rise in the prevalence of obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In this setting, the coexistence of several cardiovascular risk factors aggregating around the metabolic syndrome (MS), such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia and visceral obesity, is well-known [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. The pathophysiological relationship between cardiovascular disease and these risk factors is of great importance due to their high morbidity and mortality as well as impact on healthcare costs [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>]. Therefore, the link between visceral adiposity and insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, and subsequent atherosclerosis has been extensively studied.</p><p>Adipose tissue is a known endocrine organ secreting several soluble factors, known as adipocytokines or adipokines, some of these being adiponectin, leptin, resistin and, more recently, visfatin. They can partly explain the link between obesity, insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction, endothelial dysfunction, and atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Other known products of adipocytes are free fatty-acids, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, Monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)1, coagulation mediators such as platelet-activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, and complement components [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>].</p><p>Atherosclerosis is a complex inflammatory disease, involving many physiological mechanisms, in which immunologic, metabolic, genetic, and environmental factors interact. The endothelium plays a pivotal role in these interactions, through disequilibrium in regulation of vascular tonus (endothelium-dependent relaxation), platelet aggregation, coagulation, and fibrinolysis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>]. Risk factors for this condition have been continuously identified.</p><p>Adipocytokines may have a role in each one of these processes, explaining at least in part the association between obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Visfatin</title><p>Visfatin is an adipokine identified in 2004 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>] and thus named for the suggestion that it would be predominantly produced and secreted in visceral fat. Visfatin is highly preserved across animal evolution. It has a molecular weight of 52 KDa and its gene encodes 491 aminoacids. It is identical to pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF), described in 1994 as a cytokine produced by lymphocytes, acting on lymphocyte maturation and inflammatory regulation. Visfatin was also soon recognized as the formerly described Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), the limiting enzyme in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis. In addition to being produced in human leukocytes and adipose tissue, visfatin is also expressed in human and animal hepatocytes and muscles [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>] and in animal adipocytes, kidney and heart [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. Visfatin was found to be released predominantly from macrophages rather than from adipocytes in visceral adipose tissue. In this regard, there is sufficient evidence to consider that visfatin is expressed by the macrophages infiltrating adipose tissue and is produced in response to inflammatory signals [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>]. It is now believed that visfatin actions can be endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine as well. These autocrine effects of visfatin may play an important role in regulating insulin sensitivity in the liver [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>].</p><p>Fukuhara et al. investigated genes having diverse patterns of expression in subcutaneous and visceral fat from two human subjects, identifying one gene with this feature [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. Sequencing revealed this gene to correspond to PBEF. Increased visfatin expression and secretion was found during cell differentiation of cultured adipocytes. Moreover, studying 101 humans, strong correlation between visceral fat estimated by computed tomography (CT) and visfatin plasma levels was found, as well as a weak correlation between visfatin levels and subcutaneous fat. Furthermore, an increased visceral fat expression of visfatin was demonstrated after weight gain in obese diabetic mice. In these animals, acute administration of recombinant visfatin decreased plasma glucose in a dose-dependent fashion, in both insulin-resistant and insulin-deficient animals. Chronic increase of visfatin expression obtained by viral transfection has also decreased glucose in both animal models. A homozygous knockout model for the visfatin gene has been attempted, but it was incompatible with life, fetal death occurring in the initial phase of embryogenesis. However, heterozygous animals showed plasma levels of visfatin two-thirds of those seen in wild-type animals, associated to blood glucose slightly higher in fasting, post-prandial state, and after an oral glucose load. In addition, the study has demonstrated insulin-mimetic effects of visfatin such as: increased glucose uptake in adipocytes and myocytes, suppression of hepatic glucose release, stimulated triglyceride accumulation, and increase in its synthesis in pre-adipocytes.</p><p>Further on, the authors investigated the intracellular signaling of visfatin and suggested it to tyrosine-phosphorylate the insulin receptor in hepatocytes, myocytes, and adipocytes. Competitive inhibition testing showed that both molecules do not compete for the insulin receptor, raising the hypothesis that visfatin could have a binding site different from that of insulin. Actually, recombinant receptors with structural changes decreasing affinity for insulin didn\\'t change visfatin binding.</p><p>This study has opened a broad perspective for the role of visfatin in mechanisms of glucose control. Although its insulin-mimetic effects have been questioned, generating a retraction by the author in 2007 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>], numerous subsequent studies demonstrated visfatin to bear important metabolic effects as discussed below.</p></sec><sec><title>General actions of Visfatin and correlations with medical conditions</title><p>Subsequent publications have reported various effects and correlations between visfatin plasma levels with various medical conditions (Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>). It possesses anti-apoptotic effects on neutrophils in both animal and clinical models of sepsis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>]. It is also increased in acute pulmonary lesion, being useful as a marker of this condition [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. Visfatin is also diminished in patients with steatohepatitis when compared to pure steatosis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>]. However, increased visfatin levels correlated positively with portal inflammation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>]. These observations could suggest an association of visfatin with inflammation. Negative correlation of visfatin with creatinine clearance and positive correlation with urinary albumin excretion has been demonstrated, suggesting visfatin circulating levels to be influenced by renal function [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. An inhibitor of visfatin (FK866) is being tested as a potential anti-tumor agent due to NAD depletion leading to apoptosis on highly metabolically active cells [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>].</p><table-wrap id=\"T1\" position=\"float\"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Association between several medical conditions and visfatin</p></caption><table frame=\"hsides\" rules=\"groups\"><thead><tr><th align=\"left\">Medical Condition</th><th align=\"left\">Visfatin</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\">Atherosclerosis</td><td align=\"left\">Increased serum levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">31</xref>]<break/>Increased expression in instable plaques [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">31</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Endothelial dysfunction</td><td align=\"left\">Increased serum levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Cardioprotection</td><td align=\"left\">Reduces infarct area [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Metabolic Syndrome</td><td align=\"left\">Controversial, Increased serum levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Adiponectin</td><td align=\"left\">Controversial [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Hepatic Fat Disease</td><td align=\"left\">Diminished serum levels in steatohepatitis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>]<break/>Increased serum levels with progressive portal inflammation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Tumoral replication</td><td align=\"left\">Visfatin antagonist being tested [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Acute lung injury</td><td align=\"left\">Increased serum levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Renal insufficiency</td><td align=\"left\">Increased serum levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Beta cell function impairment</td><td align=\"left\">Increased serum levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Insulin resistance</td><td align=\"left\">No correlation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Insulin-mimetic effect</td><td align=\"left\">Controversial, no effect [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Diabetes</td><td align=\"left\">Controversial [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Obesity</td><td align=\"left\">Increased serum levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Visceral Fat</td><td align=\"left\">Controversial, no correlation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Vascular smooth muscle</td><td align=\"left\">Promotes inflammation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>]</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The relationship of visfatin with visceral fat has been questioned. Relationship of plasma visfatin levels was seen with body mass index (BMI) and percentage of body fat but not with abdominal circumference or visceral fat estimated by CT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>]. Chang et al. did not find different expression of visfatin between visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue in 53 Taiwanese adults [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>]. Nevertheless, there is strong evidence that visfatin increases with obesity as demonstrated in a prospective cohort study, in which visfatin levels were augmented in morbidly obese subjects compared to normal-weight individuals. Visfatin normalized after 6 months of bariatric surgery and consequent weight loss [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>]. Altogether current evidence does not support the notion that visfatin is predominantly expressed in visceral fat [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Visfatin in glucose metabolism</title><p>After the study by Fukuhara suggested a role of visfatin on glucose metabolism, others have investigated its relationship with T2DM, insulin secretion and sensitivity, and also with other adipokines such as adiponectin.</p><p>Revollo et al. showed that visfatin is an essential enzyme in NAD production (Nampt). It exists both in intra and extracellular environments. Mice heterozygous for mutations in the visfatin gene have glucose intolerance mainly due to insulin secretion deficiency. This insulin secretion defect can be corrected by administering nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), the product of visfatin on NAD biosynthesis. Since the pancreas has very low levels of intracellular visfatin, the author suggests that maintenance of high NMN circulating levels by extracellular visfatin would be critical for normal beta-cell function [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. Skop et al. investigated glucose uptake in animal hepatocytes with diminished visfatin expression. They found significantly reduced NAD biosynthesis and significantly decreased incremental glucose uptake after stimulation with insulin when compared to control hepatocytes with normal expression of visfatin [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>]. A negative correlation of visfatin levels with beta-cell function was demonstrated by studying acute insulin secretion assessed by an intravenous glucose tolerance test [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>]. Furthermore, continuous glucose infusion in humans acutely increases visfatin levels. This effect is suppressed by insulin or somatostatin infusion [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>].</p><p>Brown and co-authors demonstrated that incubation with visfatin into mouse pancreatic beta-cells caused significant changes in the mRNA expression of several key diabetes-related genes, including marked up-regulation of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 homeobox B (HNF1B) among others. Visfatin also caused a significant 46% increase in insulin secretion compared to control at low glucose, and this increase was blocked by co-incubation with the specific visfatin inhibitor FK866. Both visfatin and NMN induced activation of insulin receptor and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, with visfatin-induced activation of insulin receptor and ERK1/2 being inhibited by FK866. The authors suggested that visfatin can significantly regulate insulin secretion, insulin receptor phosphorylation, and expression of a number of genes associated with beta-cell function in mice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>].</p><p>Visfatin levels were also investigated in some population based studies. Chen et al., investigating visfatin levels in a Chinese population, found a positive association between visfatin and the presence of T2DM, even after adjustment for BMI, age, sex, smoking status, blood pressure, and lipid profile [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>]. Dogru et al., studying visfatin levels in 40 subjects with newly diagnosed diabetes or glucose intolerance, found that visfatin levels were higher in the diabetic patients when compared to controls, but not when compared to glucose intolerant patients (pre-diabetes)[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. Patients with both long duration type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and T2DM had higher visfatin levels compared to non-diabetic controls or recently diagnosed diabetic individuals. In T2DM, visfatin levels were partly associated to higher glycated hemoglobin levels (A1C) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>]. Nevertheless, Takebayashi found no correlation between diabetes and visfatin [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>], while another study, demonstrated decreased visfatin in patients with T1DM and inverse relationship between A1C and visfatin levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>].</p><p>The relationship between visfatin levels and insulin resistance surrogates was also investigated. However, it was not possible to demonstrate correlation of visfatin with HOMA-IR [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>]. HOMA-IR also did not show correlation with visfatin expression on visceral adipose tissue but was positively associated with visfatin expression in subcutaneous adipocytes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>]. Furthermore, administration of the insulin sensitizer pioglitazone for 3 weeks didn\\'t affect plasma levels of visfatin in humans with recently diagnosed T2DM [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>]. The same drug administered for 12 weeks did not change visfatin levels either [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. This is not, apparently, a general effect of thiazolidinediones, since rosiglitazone administered for 3 weeks increased visfatin levels in normoglycemic individuals [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>].</p><p>Current data suggests that visfatin is important to normal insulin secretion, but its relationship with diabetes risk and progression is still a matter of debate. Thus, visfatin may be a compensatory mechanism or part of the pathophysiology of diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Cardiovascular disease and visfatin</title><p>Oxidized LDL was verified to increase visfatin expression in cultured monocytes. Moreover, visfatin increased the expression of molecules that degrade extracellular matrix causing plaque instability. This later effect was abolished after adding an inhibitor of insulin receptor signaling [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">31</xref>].</p><p>Visfatin expression is increased in unstable coronary plaques and symptomatic carotid lesions in humans. Patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy and presenting ischemic symptoms 6 months prior to evaluation had higher visfatin expression than asymptomatic individuals. The same finding has been replicated in patients with unstable angina compared to those with stable angina. Immunohistochemical analysis of the plaques revealed higher concentration of visfatin in their lipid nucleuses compared to stable plaques. The same study showed that balloon angioplasty, acutely injuring the plaques, caused visfatin levels to peak 4 hours after the procedure, receding back to basal levels after 24 hours. Another study found a negative correlation between visfatin and endothelial function evaluated through flow-mediated or nitroglycerin-mediated dilation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. Visfatin can promote vascular smooth muscle inflammation, being associated with a potential role in vascular dysfunction and inflammation associated with some metabolic disorders [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>].</p><p>Increased visfatin levels are associated to coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute coronary syndromes even after correction for classic cardiovascular risk factors such as cholesterol, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>]. A positive association between visfatin and MS was noted, mainly among individuals with carotid atherosclerosis. Indeed, visfatin was an independent risk factor for augmented carotid intimal-media thickness [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>]. In this regard, it is well established that acute ischemic stroke is another possible consequence of atherosclerosis. Recently, higher visfatin levels were found in Chinese individuals with stroke, suggesting a possible role in this vascular disease [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>].</p><p>A cardioprotective effect of visfatin was also suggested in an animal model of non-atherosclerotic ischemia and reperfusion [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. Visfatin administered at the moment of reperfusion diminished the size of the infarcted area. This effect was mediated by the inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, a non-specific mitochondrial channel, its opening in the first few minutes of myocardial reperfusion being a critical determinant of cardiomyocyte death. The authors emphasize that this was an acute effect and chronically elevated levels of visfatin may yield different results.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic studies</title><p>The visfatin/PBEF gene consists of 11 exons and 10 introns spanning 34.7-kb and is located on chromosome 7q22.2. Few studies of polymorphic markers in the visfatin gene have been reported to date. Bottcher et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] did not find any association with either T2DM, in a cohort of 503 diabetic subjects and 476 healthy controls, or with T2DM-related traits in 626 non-diabetic subjects from Germany. However, they found an association between the -948 G &#x0003e; T single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and fasting insulin levels in non-diabetic subjects (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05). The ratio of visceral/subcutaneous visfatin mRNA expression was associated with all three genetic polymorphisms studied (rs9770242, -948G &#x0003e; T, rs4730153).</p><p>To investigate the role of visfatin gene variants in obesity-related phenotypes, Bailey et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>] genotyped a total of 13 SNPs in the promoter region of the gene in 918 participants from 208 families evaluated in the Quebec Family Study. A significant association was found between two SNPs (rs9770242 and rs1319501) and fasting insulin levels (<italic>p </italic>= 0.002). These SNPs were also associated with fasting glucose (<italic>p </italic>= 0.02). Furthermore, they found that a more distal SNP (rs7789066) was significantly associated with the apolipoprotein B component of VLDL (<italic>p </italic>= 0.012).</p><p>Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] studied a group of 814 white patients from the USA and a group of non-diabetic controls (n = 320). They found a significant association between -948C &#x0003e; A and T2DM (<italic>p </italic>= 0.021). In a non-diabetic population (n = 630), the same -948C allele that conferred increased risk of T2DM was significantly associated with higher plasma levels of fibrinogen and C-reactive protein (<italic>p </italic>= 0.0022 and 0.0038, respectively). However, no significant associations were observed with BMI, waist circumference, serum glucose levels, or fasting insulin levels. They suggested that the visfatin gene may play a role in determining T2DM susceptibility, possibly by modulating chronic, low-grade inflammatory responses.</p><p>Korner et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] studied 731 schoolchildren and an independent cohort of 167 obese children from Germany. They genotyped 3 SNPs (rs9770242, -948G &#x0003e; T, rs4730153). The authors did not find association of any of the 3 polymorphisms or their haplotypes with BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, glucose, insulin, or lipid levels. However, the -948G variant was associated with significantly higher diastolic blood pressure in obese children (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05 after adjusting for age, sex, pubertal stage, and height).</p><p>Blakemore et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>] studied 1,709 severely obese subjects together with 2,367 T2DM individuals and 2,850 controls. For quantitative trait analysis, an additional 2,362 subjects were typed for rs10487818 from a general population sample. This rare SNP, rs10487818, located in intron 4, was associated with protective effect against severe obesity. This is one of the first rare SNPs shown to be protective against a common polygenic disease like obesity and provides further evidence that rare alleles of strong effect can contribute to this kind of complex diseases.</p><p>More recently, Yan et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] suggested that Visfatin -1535C &#x0003e; T polymorphism might be associated with reduced risk of CAD in a Chinese population. There was a significant association between Visfatin -1535C &#x0003e; T polymorphism and triglyceride levels in both CAD patients and controls (<italic>p </italic>= 0.003). In non diabetic Japanese subjects, Tokunaga et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>] found that the -1535T/T genotype modulates lipid levels promoting lower serum triglyceride levels and higher HDL-cholesterol levels. In this investigation, reporter gene assay of 3T3-L1 adipocytes revealed that the promoter activity of -1535T and -1535C was similar, suggesting that the observed association may reflect linkage disequilibrium between -1535T &#x0003e; C and other causative variations of the visfatin gene.</p><p>Taken together, these studies suggest that genetic variants in the Visfatin gene can be associated with some phenotypes related to glucose, lipids, and other metabolic and vascular traits. Further studies in other populations must be carried out to better clarify these points.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion and perspectives</title><p>Visfatin is is an adipokine involved in inflammatory phenomena, atherosclerosis, and possibly in insulin secretion. Its physiology has begun to be described but its role on diabetes and CAD pathophysiology is still controversial.</p><p>New studies may define the possible role of visfatin in the mechanisms of glycemic control, vascular function and atherosclerotic process. These findings may contribute in the identification of higher risk individuals as well as lead to new therapeutic approaches. Genetic studies about the visfatin gene and its variations will also contribute to the elucidation of these phenomena.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>BMI: body mass index; CAD: coronary artery disease; CT: computed tomography; mPTP: mitochondrial permeability transition pore; MS: metabolic syndrome; NAD: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; Nampt: nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; NMN: nicotinamide mononucleotide; PBEF: pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor; SNP: single-nucleotide polymorphism; T1DM: type 1 diabetes mellitus; T2DM; type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors\\' contributions</title><p>PSR and CSVO performed the literature review and drafted the manuscript; FMAG supervised the project, helped in literature review and critically revised the manuscript for important intellectual content.

The diagnostic criteria include two out of three features: hyperandrogenism, polycystic ovaries on ultrasound and menstrual irregularities (Rotterdam Criteria 2003). PCOS patients are more vulnerable to develop diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance (IR) is prevalent in women with PCOS independently of obesity and is critically involved in reproductive and metabolic complications of the syndrome. Several tests have been developed to measure IR, some very reliable but complex like the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp and others less precise but easier and less invasive like HOMA-IR. New markers are needed to reach a more reliable assessment of insulin resistance. To date, several surrogate markers have been proposed in the literature to facilitate and improve the determination of IR. Many new proteins are strongly involved with PCOS physiopathology and IR, such as some adipocytokines (adiponectin, visfatin, vaspin and apelin), copeptin, irisin, PAI-1 and zonulin. Many other proteins have been proposed as potential new markers of IR in PCOS, such as resistin, leptin, RBP4, kisspetin and ghrelin, but their role is still controversial. In this review, we provide a short characterization of these new markers, recently studied as indicators of metabolic state.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang=\"en\"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Polycystic ovary syndrome</kwd><kwd>Insulin resistance</kwd><kwd>Markers</kwd><kwd>Adipocytokines</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id=\"Sec1\" sec-type=\"introduction\"><title>Introduction</title><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disease linked with metabolic complications, and insulin resistance (IR) plays an important role in the development and persistence of this disorder [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR1\">1</xref>]. The gold standard for directly measuring insulin sensitivity in humans is the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp, but it is time consuming, labor intensive, expensive and technically demanding [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>]. The homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) is the main method for IR measurement used in scientific studies because it is a simple and noninvasive [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>]. Due to the relevance of IR in the setting of PCOS, it would be important for both research and clinical application to identify additional biochemical parameters that may help in identifying IR.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec2\"><title>PCOS and insulin resistance</title><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder affecting 10&#x02013;15&#x000a0;% of women in reproductive age. The etiology of the disease is still not totally understood, and the clinical presentation is extremely variable but generally includes clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, menstrual disorders (oligo-amenorrhea) and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound.</p><p>In the last years, specific diagnostic criteria were developed to allow the diagnosis of PCOS. In 1990 were established the criteria of the National Institute of Health (NIH), followed by ESHRE/ASRM (European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology/American Society of Reproduction Medicine) criteria established in Rotterdam in 2003. After exclusion of other diseases, the diagnosis of PCOS requires two out of the following three criteria: oligo-anovulation, clinical or biochemical androgen excess, ultrasound polycystic morphology of at least one ovary (at least 12 follicles measuring 2&#x02013;9&#x000a0;mm in diameter or ovarian volume greater than 10&#x000a0;cm<sup>3</sup>).</p><p>In 2011, the Amsterdam ESHRE/ASMR-sponsored 3rd PCOS Consensus Workshop Group identified different PCOS phenotypes, separating the classic phenotype (hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation, with or without PCO) from those with ovulation disorders and polycystic morphology [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR4\">4</xref>].</p><p>The clinical phenotypes present different metabolic risks, and IR is a hallmark of the classic and the ovulatory phenotypes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>]. IR and hyperinsulinemia determine hyperandrogenemia stimulating ovarian theca cells to secrete androgens and increasing LH effect on ovarian androgen production. Both androgens and insulin inhibit SHBG secretion, increasing free and bioactive androgen levels and making clinical androgen excess worse. Moreover, IR is critically involved in the development of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease in PCOS women, that is why its treatment (lifestyle changes, insulin-sensitizing drugs and bariatric surgery) is thought to important both to decrease IR and to alleviate its consequences [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>].</p><p>Measuring insulin resistance is neither simple nor necessarily accurate. This is why several tests have been developed to quantify this metabolic phenomenon. Some of these tests are very reliable but complex, while others are less precise but more readily usable in clinical research due to simplicity and reduced invasiveness. Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp is the gold standard for directly determining metabolic insulin sensitivity. It consists in a constant insulin infusion resulting in a new steady-state insulin level above the fasting level that enhances glucose disposal in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and inhibits hepatic glucose production. 20&#x000a0;% dextrose is given to &#x0201c;clamp&#x0201d; blood glucose levels in the euglycemic range. This technique directly measures all body glucose disposal under steady-state insulin conditions, but it is time consuming, labor intensive, expensive and technically demanding [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>].</p><p>The homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) determines IR and pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell function from basal glucose and insulin (or C-peptide) levels with a simple mathematically derived nonlinear equation (HOMA-IR: fasting insulin (mU/ml)&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;fasting glucose (mmol/l)/22.5 (normalizing factor)) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>].</p><p>The quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) is a simple variation of the HOMA equation that provides a consistent and accurate insulin sensitivity index with positive predictive power and with a significantly better correlation with glucose clamp determinations of insulin sensitivity than other simple surrogates [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>]. It is easy, minimally invasive, inexpensive and commonly used in clinical research studies.</p><p>The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is a simple test widely used in medical practice to identify glucose intolerance or type 2 diabetes. After an oral glucose load (75&#x000a0;g), blood glucose and insulin concentrations are determined at 0, 30, 60 and 120&#x000a0;min. OGTT provides important information about glucose tolerance, but not insulin sensitivity/resistance per se [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR8\">8</xref>].</p><p>The minimal model analysis of the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT) is a simple indirect measurement of insulin sensitivity/resistance. Blood samples are taken for 3&#x000a0;h after an intravenous bolus of glucose administration followed by an insulin infusion. The collected data are analyzed using a computer program MINMOD to provide an insulin sensitivity index [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR9\">9</xref>].</p><p>Matsuda index is a simple assessment of insulin sensitivity from the OGTT that provides an excellent approximation of whole-body insulin sensitivity (WBISI&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10,000/&#x0221a; (fasting glucose&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;fasting insulin) (mean glucose&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;mean insulin) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec3\"><title>New markers: structure, action and role in insulin resistance</title><p>Although several tests exist to assess insulin resistance, the availability of new markers is highly needed, in the aim to achieve a more reliable assessment of insulin metabolism. To date, a number of new proteins have been proposed as surrogate markers for the assessment of insulin resistance. Below, we provide a short characterization of markers, which have recently been studied as serum/plasma indicators of metabolic state.</p><sec id=\"Sec4\"><title>Adipocytokines</title><p>Adipose tissue is implicated in the secretion of several hormones such as adiponectin, resistin, leptin, visfatin, apelin, retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP 4), called adipocytokines, that are involved in energy homeostasis and metabolism [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR11\">11</xref>].</p><p>Adiponectin is secreted exclusively by mature adipocytes. Decreased adiponectin plasma levels are associated with insulin resistance [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR12\">12</xref>], obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>]. There are many scientific studies on adiponectin in PCOS patients. Sepilian and Nagamani [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>] reported a significant negative correlation between serum adiponectin levels and insulin resistance, with no correlation between BMI and adiponectin in PCOS patients, suggesting that insulin sensitivity seems to be the major determinant of adiponectin levels rather than adiposity.</p><p>Panidis et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>] observed lower serum adiponectin levels in PCOS patients with insulin resistance (measured by HOMA-IR) than in normal population. Similar findings were observed by Yildiz et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>] who demonstrated a relationship between increased insulin resistance and decreased adiponectin levels, suggesting that it could be an adequate marker of insulin resistance and its consequences such as diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome.</p><p>Resistin is an adipose-derived peptide hormone discovered in 2001 that potentially links obesity and diabetes mellitus [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref>]. The role of resistin in insulin resistance of PCOS is still controversial. Seow et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>] found that hyperinsulinemic PCOS patients and controls had similar serum resistin levels, but resistin mRNA levels were twofold higher in adipocytes from PCOS patients, suggesting a paracrine regulation of insulin resistance. Lewandowski et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR19\">19</xref>] reported a strong negative correlation between adiponectin and resistin levels in PCOS women during OGTT but without a direct correlation with insulin resistance, and they speculated that the adiponectin-to-resistin ratio might help in predicting the cardiovascular risk in these patients. Higher resistin levels were found in PCOS patients by Yilmaz et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>], but independently from insulin resistance and BMI. Wang et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>] observed significantly higher resistin levels in obese and non-obese PCOS groups than in controls and HOMA-IR had a positive correlation with resistin and a negative correlation with adiponectin. Conversely, Pangaribuan et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR22\">22</xref>] found that none of the 24 PCOS patients in their study presented hyperesistinemia, there was no significant difference in serum resistin concentration between PCOS group and controls, and there was no correlation with BMI and HOMA-IR; instead, they showed that lower adiponectin level was associated with insulin resistance and BMI in PCOS women.</p><p>Leptin is a peptide hormone secreted from adipose tissue and plays an important role in food intake and energy homeostasis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. Insulin stimulates leptin gene expression, enhancing leptin secretion [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>]. The implication of leptin in insulin resistance of PCOS is still unclear. Mici&#x00107; et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR25\">25</xref>] found significantly higher leptin levels in obese PCOS patients compared with non-obese PCOS women and controls with a negative correlation between insulin sensitivity and leptin levels in both PCOS groups. Some years later, Erturk et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR26\">26</xref>] did not reveal significant correlation between leptin and HOMA-IR or hyperinsulinemia, suggesting that leptin levels are related only to obesity. Opposite results were obtained by Pehlivanov and Mitkov [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR27\">27</xref>], who showed a positive correlation between serum leptin levels and insulin resistance, independently of obesity. One possible explanation for this difference is the heterogeneity of the patients, who presented the BMI in the upper limit of normal values. Recently, similar to Erturk&#x02019;s study, Nasrat et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR28\">28</xref>] found that leptin and BMI were significantly correlated without a significant association with insulin resistance, but they evaluated only PCOS patients without a control group and they did not analyze the molecular mechanisms for further validation. Garruti et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR29\">29</xref>] reported low leptin levels in serum and in follicular fluid in non-obese PCOS patients undergoing in vitro fertilization, with a significant correlation with BMI and insulinemia.</p><p>In 2005, Fukuhara and his group isolated a new adipocytokine called visfatin, which expression increases in obesity. Visfatin has an insulin-mimetic effect in mice and in vitro reduces plasma glucose levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR31\">31</xref>]. Kowalska et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR32\">32</xref>] reported lower insulin sensitivity in both lean and obese PCOS patients, but increased serum visfatin levels only in lean PCOS women with a negative correlation with insulin sensitivity and a positive correlation with markers of hyperandrogenism, suggesting that obesity may deregulate visfatin expression and that other factors may be involved in this process. Similar findings in non-obese PCOS subjects were observed by Gen et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR33\">33</xref>], who reported also a strong association with total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein and markers of hyperandrogenism. Later, in a study performed on obese PCOS adolescent girls, Cekmez et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR34\">34</xref>] showed a significant enhancement of HOMA-IR and visfatin and apelin levels and significantly lower adiponectin levels, speculating that adipocytokines can be used as specific markers for insulin resistance. Nevertheless, a recent meta-analysis including 1341 patients indicated visfatin levels were significantly elevated in PCOS subjects, suggesting that visfatin could be a potential biomarker for PCOS, but there was no correlation with insulin resistance, BMI and hyperandrogenism [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR35\">35</xref>].</p><p>Visceral adipose tissue-derived serine protease inhibitor (vaspin) is a novel adipocytokine identified in obese diabetic rats, where it improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR36\">36</xref>]. In a small case&#x02013;control study performed by Tan et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR37\">37</xref>], obese PCOS women had enhanced vaspin mRNA and protein in omental adipose tissue and high plasma vaspin levels, which decreased after treatment with metformin. Positive associations with HOMA-IR and glucose were found, suggesting that high vaspin levels may be a consequence of insulin resistance. Similar results were found by Koiou et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR38\">38</xref>]. In their study, serum vaspin levels were higher in both lean and obese PCOS patients than in controls. QUICKI was lower in PCOS subjects, suggesting that insulin resistance and obesity enhance vaspin levels. However, treatment with metformin, diet and weight loss appeared to not affect serum vaspin concentrations.</p><p>Apelin is a peptide isolated from bovine stomachs, but it is expressed in several other organs and also in visceral and subcutaneous tissues [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>]. Apelin was found to be higher in PCOS patients by G&#x000f6;ren et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>] but without a significant correlation with HOMA-IR. Olszanecka-Glinianowicz et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>] reported an inverse association between apelin and glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR values, supporting the role of apelin in the regulation of insulin sensitivity. Apelin levels were higher in non-obese PCOS patients, suggesting a compensatory mechanism for metabolic consequences of insulin resistance. Different from Cekmez&#x02019;s study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR34\">34</xref>], lower serum concentrations of apelin were found in PCOS subjects by Altinkaya et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>] with positive correlation with BMI, insulin, HOMA-IR, triglyceride and free testosterone, speculating that apelin can be used as a marker for insulin sensitivity. Conversely, Sun et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>] observed significantly enhanced apelin concentration in PCOS patients with positive association with BMI and HOMA-IR; treatment with drospirenone-ethinylestradiol plus metformin improved insulin resistance and apelin levels. Discrepant findings among the published studies may be attributed to the differences in ethnicity, age, study design, sample size, genetic characteristics of populations, and assessment methodology.</p><p>The data concerning serum retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), an adipocytokine involved in systemic insulin resistance, are inconclusive. Weiping et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>] found elevated RBP4 levels in PCOS patients regardless of obesity with negative correlation with insulin sensitivity, suggesting that this protein could be an important link between adipose tissue and insulin resistance in PCOS. In line with this study, M&#x000f6;hlig et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>] observed that elevated RBP4 levels were significantly associated with insulin resistance. RBP4 levels were higher in women suffering from metabolic syndrome or impaired glucose metabolism, but ROC curve analysis showed that plasma RBP4 does not appear to be a clinically useful parameter to predict metabolic consequences in PCOS women. On the other hand, Hanh et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>] noted that RBP4 were associated with obesity but not with indices of insulin resistance and they found no differences in RBP4 concentrations between PCOS patients and controls, concluding that its levels are not influenced by PCOS per se. No correlation with insulin resistance was found also by Hutchison et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR47\">47</xref>], who noted that RBP levels did not change after treatment with metformin or oral contraceptives, which reduced and enhanced insulin resistance, respectively, concluding that RBP4 cannot be used as a marker of insulin resistance in PCOS. Cohort size, the choice of methodology for the evaluation of insulin resistance, selection bias or methodological differences in RBP4 measurements could contribute to obscure this relatively small impact on IR observed. Recently, contrarily to previous studies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>], Olszanecka-Glinianowicz et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR48\">48</xref>] reported significantly higher RBP4 levels in normal weight PCOS compared to obese PCOS subjects and significantly lower concentrations in normal weight controls compared to obese controls, with a negative correlation between RBP4 and HOMA-IR or insulin concentrations, hypothesizing a compensatory effect in the negative feedback between RBP4 and insulin resistance to prevent deterioration in obese PCOS patients.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec5\"><title>Kisspeptin</title><p>In the literature, there are limited data about kisspeptin changes and hormonal and metabolic diseases. Kisspeptin, also called metastin, is a peptide produced by KiSS-1 gene involved in puberty activation and is the key stimulating factor of GnRH pulsatile secretion during the ovulation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR49\">49</xref>]. Panidis et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR50\">50</xref>] found lower kisspeptin serum levels in PCOS women than in controls, and they reported significantly higher kisspeptin levels in normal weight PCOS subjects than in overweight or obese women with the disease with negative correlation with BMI, androgens, fasting insulin levels and HOMA-IR, suggesting that insulin resistance is linked to decreased kisspeptin levels. In this study, the number of control women was relatively small and no lean healthy volunteers were involved. Therefore, it is too soon to draw definite conclusions. Different findings were reported by Jeon et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR51\">51</xref>] and Yilmaz et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR52\">52</xref>], who observed that kisspeptin levels were significantly increased in normal weight and obese PCOS women compared with controls with positive correlation with androgenic profile but without significant association with insulin resistance, suggesting that kisspeptin can be used as a specific marker for hyperandrogenism in PCOS. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the role of kisspeptin in metabolic consequences in PCOS.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec6\"><title>Copeptin</title><p>To date, few studies were performed to assess the connection between plasma copeptin levels and metabolic risk in PCOS. Saleem et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR53\">53</xref>] performed a multicenter, community-based study on 1293 African-Americans and 1197 non-Hispanic whites to investigate the association of copeptin, the C-terminal pro-vasopressin fragment, with insulin resistance and presence of metabolic syndrome. In both groups, copeptin levels were higher in participants with metabolic syndrome with positive correlation with insulin levels and HOMA-IR and independent association with adiposity and dyslipidemia, suggesting that copeptin may be a novel marker of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Karbek et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR54\">54</xref>] found enhanced copeptin levels in PCOS patients positively associated with fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, androgenic profile, triglycerides and carotid intima media thickness, indicating that copeptin may play an important role in cardiometabolic consequences in PCOS. Similar findings were observed by Taskin et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR55\">55</xref>], who reported that enhanced copeptin levels in obese PCOS women were associated with insulin resistance and obesity.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec7\"><title>Irisin</title><p>Irisin is a novel myokine recently identified in humans and mice involved in brown-fat-like development of white fat, energy expenditure, weight loss and improved glucose tolerance [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR56\">56</xref>]. The relationship between irisin and insulin resistance is still not totally elucidated, and the regulation of this myokine has yet to be demonstrated. Li et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR57\">57</xref>] demonstrated that irisin levels were significantly higher in PCOS subjects than in controls and in overweight and obese patients than in lean women in both groups. Significant positive correlation between circulating irisin with insulin resistance and dyslipidemia was found. They studied the effect of hyperinsulinemia on irisin levels with the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp: At the beginning of the assay, short-term hyperinsulinemia determined a rapid decrease of irisin concentrations in both groups, and therefore, during the steady state of the test, its levels were constant, suggesting that elevated irisin concentrations in PCOS patients may be a consequence of metabolic stress. After metformin therapy, authors observed significantly decreased irisin levels and improved insulin resistance in PCOS women. Recently, similar results were obtained by Li et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR58\">58</xref>], who noted significantly increased irisin levels in overweight and obese PCOS women with high free androgen index (FAI) with an evident increase in insulin resistance and hyperandrogenemia, suggesting that elevated irisin levels predict insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and hyperandrogenemia.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec8\"><title>Ghrelin</title><p>Ghrelin is a multifunctional peptide hormone secreted principally in the stomach. It stimulates several biological functions including food intake, glucose release, cell proliferation and reproduction [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR59\">59</xref>]. The first study assessing the relationship between ghrelin levels and insulin resistance in PCOS was performed by Sch&#x000f6;fl et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR60\">60</xref>], who compared PCOS women with healthy controls and gastrectomized subjects. In this study, ghrelin levels were lower in insulin-resistant patients and were similar to the levels found in gastrectomized women; in insulin-sensitive PCOS patients, ghrelin concentration was comparable to controls. A significant correlation between ghrelin levels and insulin resistance was found in PCOS women; treatment with metformin improved insulin sensitivity and enhanced serum ghrelin levels, suggesting that its reduction in PCOS may be a cause or a consequence of insulin resistance. Lower ghrelin levels in PCOS patients were also found by Mitkov et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR61\">61</xref>], with a strong negative association with clinical and hormonal indices of insulin resistance. These data are in conflict with Houjeghani&#x02019;s et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR62\">62</xref>] results, who did not observe significant difference in ghrelin concentration between PCOS patients and control group, without correlation with BMI and insulin resistance. Similar results were obtained recently by Cassar et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR63\">63</xref>], who reported that ghrelin and other biomarkers were strongly correlated with obesity rather than PCOS per se and that only PAI-1 may be a predictor of insulin resistance independently of PCOS status. This discrepancy of results may be explained by confounding factors, such as body weight, fat mass, age, hormonal status, and severity of disease. Ghrelin may play an important role in the development of PCOS and metabolic consequences, but to date too much heterogeneity was identified and further studies are necessary to establish the exact relationship between ghrelin levels and PCOS.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec9\"><title>PAI-1</title><p>Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a glycoprotein involved in the coagulation system, seems to play an important role in PCOS and in its metabolic consequences. Sampson et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR64\">64</xref>] reported increased PAI-1 serum concentrations in non-obese PCOS patients with a significant strong association with hyperinsulinemia. Similar findings were observed by Orio et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR65\">65</xref>] and Tarkun et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR66\">66</xref>], suggesting that increased PAI-1 levels may be a predictor factor in cardiovascular risk in PCOS women. Recently, as mentioned before, Cassar et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR67\">67</xref>] found that PAI-1 was the only biomarker linked to insulin resistance in PCOS subject, with high accuracy to predict IR (&#x0003e;70&#x000a0;%), while other biomarkers investigated in the study (ghrelin, visfatin, leptin, C-protein) were more strongly correlated with BMI rather than PCOS status.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec10\"><title>Zonulin</title><p>Zonulin is a novel eukaryotic protein that reversibly regulates gut permeability opening intestinal tight junctions and seems involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR67\">67</xref>]. The association between zonulin and metabolic disorders has been recently recognized. Moreno-Navarrete et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR68\">68</xref>] investigated the relationship between this protein and obesity and insulin resistance, and they found that zonulin levels appear to be significantly increased in obese and glucose-intolerant subjects with a positive correlation with insulin resistance and inflammatory markers such as IL-6. To date, there is only one study that investigates serum zonulin levels in PCOS patients. Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR69\">69</xref>] reported significantly elevated zonulin levels in women with the disease compared to controls and demonstrated a strong correlation with insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia and severity of menstrual disorders, speculating that increased gut permeability may alter the intestinal barrier determining an inflammatory state that leads to insulin resistance. Further studies are necessary to confirm the role of zonulin and alterations of intestinal permeability in the physiopathology of PCOS.</p></sec></sec><sec id=\"Sec11\" sec-type=\"conclusion\"><title>Conclusions</title><p>With this article, we provide a short characterization of a variety of methods used for the determination of insulin resistance/sensitivity in PCOS patients. The gold standard for direct measurement of insulin sensitivity is the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp technique, but HOMA-IR and QUICKI are the most used methods in the scientific literature [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>]. Many new proteins are now surfacing as potential new markers of insulin resistance in PCOS. In the scientific literature, we found a strong connection between adipocytokines (in particular adiponectin, visfatin, vaspin and apelin), copeptin, irisin, PAI-1 and zonulin with insulin resistance and PCOS physiopathology, while the role of other proteins (such as resistin, leptin, RBP4, kisspetin and ghrelin) is still controversial. Many scientific articles tried to use surrogate markers to simplify the assessment of insulin resistance, anticipate the diagnosis of metabolic and cardiovascular consequences in PCOS, improve the use of medical resources, and reduce costs and side effect. Further studies are necessary to better clarify the role of these proteins with insulin resistance in this syndrome.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type=\"COI-statement\"><title>Compliance with

Five years ago, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt was identified as a novel adipocytokine. In the context of metabolic disorders, extracellular visfatin/PBEF/Nampt was initially claimed as a potentially beneficial molecule due to its insulin-mimetic and glucose-lowering properties. Nevertheless, growing evidence has since then unveiled that visfatin/PBEF/Nampt may rather be a biomarker of inflammation and endothelial damage, and also a direct regulator of the cardiovascular system that modulates cell proliferation and survival, extracellular matrix, vascular reactivity, and inflammation. On one side, the blockade of the deleterious cardiovascular actions of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt is being regarded as a potential approach to prevent and treat, not only cardio-metabolic complications, but also other pathologies implying excessive angiogenesis. Conversely, the administration of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt has shown beneficial effects in different ischemic conditions. Further research is required to evaluate the real value of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt as a pharmacological target.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>visfatin/PBEF/Nampt</kwd><kwd>adipocytokine</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>proliferation</kwd><kwd>atherosclerosis</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count=\"3\"/><table-count count=\"0\"/><equation-count count=\"0\"/><ref-count count=\"52\"/><page-count count=\"7\"/><word-count count=\"5668\"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type=\"\"><title>Introduction</title><p>The adipose tissue is nowadays considered as an active endocrine organ that produces a heterogeneous series of bioactive factors, the so-called adipocytokines. These adipocytokines can act locally within the adipose tissue, but they can also reach distant organs through the systemic circulation, where they can exert a wide range of biological actions, including the regulation of food intake and body weight, insulin sensitivity, reproduction, immunity, inflammation, or vascular homeostasis (Lau et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">2005</xref>; Guzik et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">2006</xref>). Importantly, an imbalanced adipocytokine production, as observed in clinical metabolic conditions including obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, has been associated with adipose tissue inflammation and the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, but also with chronic systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction (Karastergiou and Mohamed-Ali, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">2010</xref>). In the last years, a growing interest has emerged to understand the involvement of adipocytokines as direct players in the development of cardiovascular complications associated to metabolic diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Visfatin/PBEF/Nampt</title><p>In 2005, Fukuhara et al. (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">2005</xref>) first identified visfatin as an adipocytokine. The authors also described visfatin as an insulin-mimetic with potential beneficial effects in clinical conditions, such as diabetes mellitus. However, as the glucose-lowering properties of visfatin were hardly reproduced, the authors later on retracted from such statement (Fukuhara et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">2007</xref>). Visfatin was found to be identical to pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF), a 52-kDa cytokine acting on early B-lineage precursor cells (Samal et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">1994</xref>) and also to the enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) (Rongvaux et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">2002</xref>). In vertebrates, intracellular Nampt plays an essential role in the biosynthesis of NAD+ by converting nicotinamide into nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which is in turn transformed into NAD+ by nicotinamide/nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (Nmnat) (Formentini et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">2009</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref>). Based on these observations, visfatin is nowadays termed as visfatin/PBEF/Nampt.</p><fig id=\"F1\" position=\"float\"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) enzymatic activity</bold>. Nampt uses nicotinamide as substrate to yield nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). In a subsequent step, NMN can be transformed into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (Nmnat). The experimental drug APO866 inhibits Nampt activity. ATP, adenosine triphosphate.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"fphar-01-00135-g001\"/></fig><p>Two different forms of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt have been identified to date. On one side, intracellular visfatin/PBEF/Nampt plays a central role in maintaining the activity of NAD-dependent enzymes and is implicated in the regulation of cellular metabolism in response to nutrient availability, maturation and survival (Revollo et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">2004</xref>; van der Veer et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B46\">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B45\">2007</xref>; Ho et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">2009</xref>). On the other side, extracellular visfatin/PBEF/Nampt can be synthesized and released to the extracellular milieu, not only by adipocytes but also by many different cell types, where it can exert a wide range of actions in a paracrine or endocrine manner. Indeed, extracellular visfatin/PBEF/Nampt shows a slightly higher molecular weight than the intracellular isoform and seems to undergo post-translational modifications (Revollo et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">2007</xref>).</p><p>In the context of metabolic diseases, circulating visfatin/PBEF/Nampt levels have been found elevated in different clinical conditions, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome (Fukuhara et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">2005</xref>; Sandeep et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">2007</xref>). However, as recently reviewed, there is some controversy among the different reports studying the variation of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt levels in these disease states, where visfatin/PBEF/Nampt has also been found unmodified or even lower compared to healthy controls (Filippatos et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">2010</xref>).</p><p>Although visfatin/PBEF/Nampt was initially claimed as being preferentially released by visceral versus subcutaneous fat (Fukuhara et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">2005</xref>), this latter affirmation remains controversial (Arner, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">2006</xref>). Importantly, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt has been detected in the perivascular fat of vessels, such as aorta or coronary artery, in both animal models and humans (Wang et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B47\">2009</xref>; Spiroglou et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">2010</xref>). In fact, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt is released by a wide series of cell types, including activated monocytes/macrophages that can directly interact with vascular cells (Stephens and Vidal-Puig, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">2006</xref>). These findings indicate that, besides circulating visfatin/PBEF/Nampt, locally synthesized visfatin/PBEF/Nampt may also exert a relevant paracrine action in regulating the vascular function. This review will focus on the actions elicited by extracellular visfatin/Nampt/PBEF on the cardiovascular system (summarized in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>), where it might become a novel therapeutic target.</p><fig id=\"F2\" position=\"float\"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Diagram summarizing the main reported actions of visfatin/Nampt/PBEF in the cardiovascular system</bold>. The arrows indicate the potential clinical and therapeutical consequences of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt action (orange arrows, detrimental actions; green arrows, beneficial actions). Some of the actions of visfatin remain to date highly contradictory, such as its role in the regulation of the vascular tone.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"fphar-01-00135-g002\"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Vascular Cell Proliferation</title><sec><title>Endothelial cells</title><p>In the last years, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt has been identified as a pro-angiogenic molecule. Hence, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt concentration-dependently promotes cell proliferation, migration and capillary-like tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells cultures (HUVEC) (Kim et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">2007</xref>; Adya et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">2008a</xref>; Lovren et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">2009</xref>; Xiao et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">2009</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt promotes the formation of functional neovessels (Kim et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">2007</xref>). Furthermore, the injection of a plasmid containing visfatin/PBEF/Nampt in a mouse model of unilateral limb ischemia results in improved limb perfusion as compared to untreated animals (Lovren et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">2009</xref>).</p><p>The proliferative effect of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt in endothelial cells relies, at least in part, on the synthesis and secretion of vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) (Adya et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">2008a</xref>), a key molecule in endothelial proliferation and neovessel formation. Visfatin/PBEF/Nampt also up-regulates the VEGF receptor 2, which mediates the angiogenic actions of VEGF (Adya et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">2008a</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">b</xref>). An enhanced production of nitric oxide (NO), as the consequence of increased expression and activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), has also been proposed to be on the basis of the pro-angiogenic action of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt in human endothelial cells (Lovren et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">2009</xref>). Furthermore, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt activates dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) (Xiao et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">2009</xref>), an enzyme that hydrolyses the eNOS inhibitor <sc>l</sc>-arginine analog asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), and upregulates VEGF expression and release in endothelial cells (Fiedler et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">2009</xref>). Furthermore, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt enhances the expression, protein levels and activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2/9, as pivotal enzymes that facilitate angiogenesis through the degradation of the extracellular matrix, while it decreases the levels of the tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMP)-1 and 2 (Adya et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">2008a</xref>). Finally, both monocyte chemottractant protein (MCP)-1 (Adya et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">2009</xref>) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 (Bae et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">2009</xref>) have also been identified as mediators of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt-induced angiogenesis.</p><p>Regarding intracellular signaling, several reports have shown that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 mediate most of the cellular events leading to visfatin/PBEF/Nampt-induced endothelial cell proliferation (Kim et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">2007</xref>; Adya et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">2009</xref>; Bae et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">2009</xref>). Other studies have involved the activation of the transcription factors nuclear factor (NF)-&#x003ba;B (Adya et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">2009</xref>) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), the latter favoring the release of interleukin (IL)-6 (Kim et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">2009</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F3\">3</xref> depicts the main cellular events triggered by visfatin/PBEF/Nampt leading to endothelial cell proliferation and migration.</p><fig id=\"F3\" position=\"float\"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Main signaling pathways that mediate visfatin/PBEF/Nampt-induced endothelial cell proliferation and migration</bold>. Visfatin/PBEF/Nampt promotes vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) synthesis and secretion and up-regulates the expression of the VEGF receptor 2. Visfatin/PBEF/Nampt favors the endothelial production of nitric oxide (NO), a promoter of VEGF release, by activating endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) via the PI3K/Akt pathway. NO production is further enhanced through the activation of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), which degrades the eNOS inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). Additionally, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt triggers the endothelial production of other pro-angiogenic molecules, such as monocyte chemoatractant protein (MCP)-1 and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2. On the other hand, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt enhances the levels and activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2/9 while decreasing the levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1/2.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href=\"fphar-01-00135-g003\"/></fig><p>Based on its pro-angiogenic properties, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt has been proposed as a potential therapeutic agent to improve blood supply in certain pathological conditions characterized by restricted blood flow such as macrovascular peripheral limb ischemia. On the other hand, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt might also be a promoter of dysregulated angiogenesis that is involved in clinical conditions such as ischemic heart disease, diabetes, or atherosclerosis and may therefore arise as a novel pharmacological target for treating such conditions. In addition, a growing interest is emerging toward visfatin/Nampt/PBEF as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment (Garten et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">2009</xref>; Bi and Che, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">2010</xref>). By inhibiting Nampt activity, the formation of new vessels that can support tumor growth might be restricted. In this context, two Nampt inhibitors FK866 (or APO866) and CSH-828 are being used in clinical trials (Ravaud et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">2005</xref>; Pogrebniak et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Vascular smooth muscle cells</title><p>Vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation is a hallmark of the development of atherosclerotic lesions. Besides endothelial cells, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt can also act as a growth factor for vascular smooth muscle cells. Indeed, Wang et al. (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B47\">2009</xref>) have shown that visfatin/PBEF/Nampt contained in the perivascular fat promotes DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in rat aortic smooth muscle cell cultures through Nampt enzymatic activity. Hence, the proliferative action of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt is mimicked by the final product of the Nampt reaction, NMN, and is abolished by the Nampt pharmacological blocker FK866 (or APO866) (Wang et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B47\">2009</xref>). Intracellularly, the activation of ERK 1/2 and p38 MAPK mediates visfatin/PBEF/Nampt-induced proliferation in vascular smooth muscle cultures (Wang et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B47\">2009</xref>). Through its growth-promoting properties for vascular smooth muscle, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt emerges as a player in the development and progression of atherosclerotic lesions.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Cell Apoptosis and Cell Survival</title><p>As stated above, intracellular visfatin/PBEF/Nampt is acknowledged to play a central role in cell maturation and survival. Similarly, extracellular visfatin/PBEF/Nampt exerts anti-apoptotic effects and promotes cell survival. Thus, it has been demonstrated that visfatin/PBEF/Nampt attenuates cell apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide in both human endothelial cells (Adya et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">2008a</xref>) and rat vascular smooth muscle cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (Wang et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B47\">2009</xref>). Importantly, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt promotes the survival of macrophages subjected to endoplasmic reticulum stress, a process associated to obesity and obesity-related complications (Li et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">2008</xref>). Such an effect of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt is not related to Nampt activity, but rather involves the release of interleukin (IL)-6 by macrophages that in turn acts in a paracrine and/or autocrine manner to activate intracellular STAT3 signaling (Li et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">2008</xref>). These data indicate that visfatin/PBEF/Nampt may affect the balance between macrophage survival and death in obesity. By promoting macrophage survival, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt may contribute, not only to adipose tissue inflammation, but also to vascular inflammation and the progression of atherosclerotic lesions, as will be discussed below.</p></sec><sec><title>Vascular Tone and Reactivity</title><p>The scarce reports available to date exploring the potential direct actions of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt on the regulation of the vascular tone are contradictory. On one hand, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt has been claimed to stimulate the expression and activity of eNOS in endothelial cells, resulting in enhanced NO production and cyclic GMP formation in human umbilical vein and coronary endothelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (Lovren et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">2009</xref>). By favoring NO release, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt might exert a vasorelaxant effect. Accordingly, it has been shown that the addition of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt to an organ bath results in the relaxation of isolated rat aortas pre-contracted with noradrenaline, through a mechanism that is independent of the insulin receptor (Yamawaki et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">2009</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, Wang et al. (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B47\">2009</xref>) could not demonstrate any contribution of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt on the regulation of the vascular tone exerted by perivascular fat on rat aortas. Furthermore, a growing bulk of evidence shows a positive association between circulating visfatin/PBEF/Nampt levels and endothelial dysfunction, assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in different clinical conditions, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (Takebayashi et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">2007</xref>) and chronic kidney disease (Yilmaz et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B50\">2008</xref>). Conversely, the normalization of endothelial function following a renal transplantation is associated with a reduction in the circulating levels of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt (Yilmaz et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">2009</xref>). These data suggest that, besides representing a potential biomarker for endothelial dysfunction and vascular damage, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt might play a direct role in impairing vascular relaxation. Additional studies using both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches are therefore needed to clarify the capacity of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt to directly regulate the vascular tone.</p></sec><sec><title>Vascular Inflammation and Atherosclerosis</title><p>In the last years, a large number of reports have highlighted the pro-inflammatory properties of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt on a wide range of cell types and tissues. As stated in the Introduction, PBEF was first identified as an immunomodulatory cytokine that synergizes with interleukin 7 (IL-7) and stem cell factor (SCF) to promote pre-B cell colony formation (Samal et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">1994</xref>). Visfatin/PBEF/Nampt is now being regarded as a marker of inflammation. Serum visfatin/PBEF/Nampt levels have been positively correlated with circulating inflammatory markers, such as IL-6, CRP and MCP-1 (Oki et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">2007</xref>; Kato et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">2009</xref>; Liu et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">2009a</xref>). Indeed, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt levels are positively associated to a series of inflammatory conditions, including osteoarthritis, acute lung injury, inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn\\'s disease, gynecological disorders, such as infection-induced pre-term birth, sepsis, or psoriasis (Moschen et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">2010</xref>).</p><p>In the context of cardiovascular diseases, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt has been proposed as a marker of atherosclerosis, a clinical condition characterized by low-grade chronic inflammation (Liu et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">2009a</xref>; Kadoglou et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">2010</xref>). Other studies, however, suggest that visfatin/PBEF/NAMPT may not directly reflect atherosclerotic changes, but rather the global inflammatory status in cardiovascular and renal patients (Kato et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">2009</xref>). Importantly, a positive correlation has been found between the expression of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt in the periaortic and pericoronary fat and coronary atherosclerosis (Spiroglou et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">2010</xref>), highlighting that perivascular visfatin/PBEF/Nampt might play an important paracrine role in the development of atherosclerotic lesions.</p><p>In this context, a growing bulk of evidence indicates that visfatin/PBEF/Nampt can directly promote vascular inflammation by activating different cell types including endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, or monocytes/macrophages. Thus, in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt activates the inflammation-related transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B (Kim et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">2008</xref>; Adya et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">2009</xref>; Lee et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">2009</xref>) and promotes the expression of cell adhesion molecules, including ICAM-1, VCAM-1, or E-selectin (Kim et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">2008</xref>; Lee et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">2009</xref>), as key molecules implicated in leukocyte recruitment and early pro-atherosclerotic events (Galkina and Ley, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">2007</xref>). Visfatin/PBEF/Nampt further promotes the endothelial release of several cytokines and chemokines by endothelial cells, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 or MCP-1 and its putative receptor CCR2 (Lee et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">2009</xref>; Liu et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">2009b</xref>), and thus promotes the adhesion of human THP-1 monocytes to endothelial cells (Liu et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">2009b</xref>). The MAPK ERK 1/2 and p38, as well as PI3K and the intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species, have been involved in endothelial cell inflammation induced by visfatin/PBEF/Nampt (Kim et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">2008</xref>; Liu et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">2009b</xref>).</p><p>In human vascular smooth muscle cell cultures, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt consecutively activates ERK 1/2 and NF-&#x003ba;B, that in turn stimulates the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (Romacho et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">2009</xref>), a NO- and peroxynitrite-forming pro-inflammatory enzyme playing a key role in vascular damage and endothelial dysfunction (Pacher et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">2005</xref>). The pro-inflammatory action of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt in human vascular smooth muscle cells is not mediated by the insulin receptor, but rather relies on Nampt intrinsic activity. Accordingly, the pro-inflammatory action of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt is prevented by the pharmacological Nampt inhibitor APO866 and mimicked by NMN, the final product of the reaction catalyzed by Nampt (Romacho et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">2009</xref>).</p><p>Visfatin/PBEF/Nampt can also contribute to vascular inflammation through its direct actions on monocytes. Hence, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt promotes the synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; and IL-8, by peripheral mononuclear cells (Dahl et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">2007</xref>). As stated above, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt promotes macrophage survival (Li et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">2008</xref>), which may help perpetuating vascular inflammation.</p><p>Matrix metalloproteinases are pivotal enzymes mediating the degradation of extracellular matrix and facilitating atherosclerotic plaque fragility and disruption. In endothelial cells (Adya et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2008b</xref>), but also in monocytes (Dahl et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">2007</xref>), visfatin/PBEF/Nampt induces the expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Interestingly, an enhanced visfatin/PBEF/Nampt content has been detected in human unstable versus stable carotid plaque samples (Dahl et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">2007</xref>). Furthermore, a positive association between visfatin/PBEF/Nampt and unstable atherosclerotic lesions is also found in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute myocardial infarction, with a strong visfatin/PBEF/Nampt immunostaining observed in lipid-rich regions at the site of plaque rupture (Dahl et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">2007</xref>). Immunoreactive visfatin/PBEF/Nampt has also been detected in vascular smooth muscle cells within the atherosclerotic plaque (Spiroglou et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">2010</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that visfatin/PBEF/Nampt can be a relevant molecule in plaque weakening.</p><p>Through its multiple actions promoting cytokine and chemokine secretion, macrophage survival, leukocyte recruitment by endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cell inflammation and matrix degradation, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt, either circulating or locally synthesized, may contribute to the development of atherosclerotic lesions and plaque vulnerability and rupture. Visfatin/PBEF/Nampt is therefore gaining relevance as a potential therapeutic target to interfere with the inflammatory response associated to obesity-related complications, especially to atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Cardiac Actions</title><p>To date, only few reports have studied the direct effects of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt on cardiac function, showing apparently opposite results. On one side, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt may be involved in the pathogenesis of myocardial fibrosis; on the other, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt has been claimed to possess potential cardioprotective properties.</p><p>The proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts and the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix are at the basis of myocardial fibrosis. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have recently shown that visfatin/PBEF/Nampt promotes DNA synthesis and proliferation of cultured cardiac fibroblasts (Yu et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">2010</xref>). The expression and protein levels of procollagen I and II are also elevated in cardiac fibroblasts stimulated with visfatin/PBEF/Nampt, which ultimately leads to enhanced type I and III collagen release (Yu et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">2010</xref>). The stimulation of cardiac fibroblasts by visfatin/PBEF/Nampt involves the activation of Akt/PKB and the MAP kinases p38 and JNK, but not ERK 1/2 (Yu et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">2010</xref>). Taking into account that visfatin/PBEF/Nampt is expressed in periadventitial and apical epicardial adipose tissue (Spiroglou et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">2010</xref>), both locally produced and circulating visfatin/PBEF/Nampt could play a detrimental role in promoting myocardial fibrosis.</p><p>Conversely, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt could exert direct cardioprotective properties in a clinical condition, like myocardial reperfusion. Hence, Lim et al. (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">2008</xref>) have shown that, in a mouse model of ischemia&#x02013;reperfusion, the administration of an intravenous bolus of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt at the time of reperfusion reduced the infarct size by around 20% (Lim et al., <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">2008</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, murine cardiomyocytes submitted to hypoxia and reoxygenation, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt administered at the time of reoxygenation, exhibit significantly diminished cell death delayed, due at least in part to a delayed opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) by oxidative stress. The opening of mTPT, a non-specific mitochondrial channel, in the first minutes of reperfusion appears is a critical determinant of cardiomyocyte death (Hausenloy and Yellon, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">2003</xref>). The mechanism by which visfatin/PBEF/Nampt protects cardiomyocytes from ischemic damage remains unveiled. It has nevertheless been proposed that exogenous visfatin/PBEF/Nampt may enhance intracellular NAD+ levels through Nampt activity, conferring a higher resistance of cardiomyocytes to oxidant stress. Further studies are required to determine whether visfatin/PBEF/Nampt can represent a valuable pharmacological tool to treat cardiac damage derived from ischemia&#x02013;reperfusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions and Perspectives</title><p>Five years ago, visfatin/PBEF/Nampt was identified as a novel adipocytokine with potential beneficial effects in the context of metabolic disorders, due to its insulin-mimetic and glucose-lowering properties. Nevertheless, growing evidence has since then unveiled that visfatin/PBEF/Nampt may rather be a biomarker of inflammation and endothelial damage in metabolic diseases. Several reports have now demonstrated that visfatin/PBEF/Nampt may exert direct deleterious actions on the cardiovascular system, including cell proliferation, monocyte/macrophage activation and recruitment, vascular inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling, all of which can contribute to the development of atherosclerotic lesions. In this context, the pharmacological blockade of the cardiovascular actions on the visfatin/PBEF/Nampt might represent a novel therapeutic approach to prevent and treat cardio-metabolic complications. The blockade of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt-mediated angiogenesis might also be useful in treating but pathologies implying excessive neovascularization. On the other hand, not all the cardiovascular actions of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt are detrimental, since the administration of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt has shown beneficial effects in clinical conditions, such as peripheral limb ischemia or myocardial ischemia&#x02013;reperfusion, where it may become a beneficial pharmacological tool. Further research, using both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> approaches, is required to evaluate the real value of visfatin/PBEF/Nampt as a pharmacological target in the cardiovascular system.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Supported by grants from Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci&#x000f3;n (SAF2008-01291, SAF2008-00942, and FIS PI061779).

Visfatin was recently described as an adipocytokine with potentially important effects on glucose metabolism and atherosclerosis. Visfatin has been linked to several inflammatory conditions, beta cell function, and cardiovascular disease. The growing number of publications on the subject shall bring further evidence about this adipocytokine. Its findings may contribute in the identification of higher risk individuals for diabetes and cardiovascular disease with a better comprehension about the complex intercorrelation between adiposity, glucose metabolism and vascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/abstract&gt;&lt;/article-meta&gt;&lt;/front&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Introduction&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ongoing global epidemic of atherosclerotic disease is propelled by a concurrent rise in the prevalence of obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In this setting, the coexistence of several cardiovascular risk factors aggregating around the metabolic syndrome (MS), such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia and visceral obesity, is well-known [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\"&gt;1&lt;/xref&gt;]. The pathophysiological relationship between cardiovascular disease and these risk factors is of great importance due to their high morbidity and mortality as well as impact on healthcare costs [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\"&gt;2&lt;/xref&gt;]. Therefore, the link between visceral adiposity and insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, and subsequent atherosclerosis has been extensively studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adipose tissue is a known endocrine organ secreting several soluble factors, known as adipocytokines or adipokines, some of these being adiponectin, leptin, resistin and, more recently, visfatin. They can partly explain the link between obesity, insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction, endothelial dysfunction, and atherosclerosis [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\"&gt;3&lt;/xref&gt;]. Other known products of adipocytes are free fatty-acids, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, Monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)1, coagulation mediators such as platelet-activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, and complement components [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\"&gt;1&lt;/xref&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atherosclerosis is a complex inflammatory disease, involving many physiological mechanisms, in which immunologic, metabolic, genetic, and environmental factors interact. The endothelium plays a pivotal role in these interactions, through disequilibrium in regulation of vascular tonus (endothelium-dependent relaxation), platelet aggregation, coagulation, and fibrinolysis [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\"&gt;4&lt;/xref&gt;]. Risk factors for this condition have been continuously identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adipocytokines may have a role in each one of these processes, explaining at least in part the association between obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Visfatin&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visfatin is an adipokine identified in 2004 [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\"&gt;5&lt;/xref&gt;] and thus named for the suggestion that it would be predominantly produced and secreted in visceral fat. Visfatin is highly preserved across animal evolution. It has a molecular weight of 52 KDa and its gene encodes 491 aminoacids. It is identical to pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF), described in 1994 as a cytokine produced by lymphocytes, acting on lymphocyte maturation and inflammatory regulation. Visfatin was also soon recognized as the formerly described Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), the limiting enzyme in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis. In addition to being produced in human leukocytes and adipose tissue, visfatin is also expressed in human and animal hepatocytes and muscles [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\"&gt;6&lt;/xref&gt;,&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\"&gt;7&lt;/xref&gt;] and in animal adipocytes, kidney and heart [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\"&gt;8&lt;/xref&gt;-&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\"&gt;10&lt;/xref&gt;]. Visfatin was found to be released predominantly from macrophages rather than from adipocytes in visceral adipose tissue. In this regard, there is sufficient evidence to consider that visfatin is expressed by the macrophages infiltrating adipose tissue and is produced in response to inflammatory signals [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\"&gt;11&lt;/xref&gt;,&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\"&gt;12&lt;/xref&gt;]. It is now believed that visfatin actions can be endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine as well. These autocrine effects of visfatin may play an important role in regulating insulin sensitivity in the liver [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\"&gt;9&lt;/xref&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fukuhara et al. investigated genes having diverse patterns of expression in subcutaneous and visceral fat from two human subjects, identifying one gene with this feature [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\"&gt;5&lt;/xref&gt;]. Sequencing revealed this gene to correspond to PBEF. Increased visfatin expression and secretion was found during cell differentiation of cultured adipocytes. Moreover, studying 101 humans, strong correlation between visceral fat estimated by computed tomography (CT) and visfatin plasma levels was found, as well as a weak correlation between visfatin levels and subcutaneous fat. Furthermore, an increased visceral fat expression of visfatin was demonstrated after weight gain in obese diabetic mice. In these animals, acute administration of recombinant visfatin decreased plasma glucose in a dose-dependent fashion, in both insulin-resistant and insulin-deficient animals. Chronic increase of visfatin expression obtained by viral transfection has also decreased glucose in both animal models. A homozygous knockout model for the visfatin gene has been attempted, but it was incompatible with life, fetal death occurring in the initial phase of embryogenesis. However, heterozygous animals showed plasma levels of visfatin two-thirds of those seen in wild-type animals, associated to blood glucose slightly higher in fasting, post-prandial state, and after an oral glucose load. In addition, the study has demonstrated insulin-mimetic effects of visfatin such as: increased glucose uptake in adipocytes and myocytes, suppression of hepatic glucose release, stimulated triglyceride accumulation, and increase in its synthesis in pre-adipocytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further on, the authors investigated the intracellular signaling of visfatin and suggested it to tyrosine-phosphorylate the insulin receptor in hepatocytes, myocytes, and adipocytes. Competitive inhibition testing showed that both molecules do not compete for the insulin receptor, raising the hypothesis that visfatin could have a binding site different from that of insulin. Actually, recombinant receptors with structural changes decreasing affinity for insulin didn't change visfatin binding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study has opened a broad perspective for the role of visfatin in mechanisms of glucose control. Although its insulin-mimetic effects have been questioned, generating a retraction by the author in 2007 [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\"&gt;13&lt;/xref&gt;], numerous subsequent studies demonstrated visfatin to bear important metabolic effects as discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;General actions of Visfatin and correlations with medical conditions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequent publications have reported various effects and correlations between visfatin plasma levels with various medical conditions (Table &lt;xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\"&gt;1&lt;/xref&gt;). It possesses anti-apoptotic effects on neutrophils in both animal and clinical models of sepsis [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\"&gt;14&lt;/xref&gt;]. It is also increased in acute pulmonary lesion, being useful as a marker of this condition [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\"&gt;15&lt;/xref&gt;]. Visfatin is also diminished in patients with steatohepatitis when compared to pure steatosis [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\"&gt;16&lt;/xref&gt;]. However, increased visfatin levels correlated positively with portal inflammation [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\"&gt;17&lt;/xref&gt;]. These observations could suggest an association of visfatin with inflammation. Negative correlation of visfatin with creatinine clearance and positive correlation with urinary albumin excretion has been demonstrated, suggesting visfatin circulating levels to be influenced by renal function [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\"&gt;18&lt;/xref&gt;]. An inhibitor of visfatin (FK866) is being tested as a potential anti-tumor agent due to NAD depletion leading to apoptosis on highly metabolically active cells [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\"

visfatin with visceral fat has been questioned. Relationship of plasma visfatin levels was seen with body mass index (BMI) and percentage of body fat but not with abdominal circumference or visceral fat estimated by CT [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\"&gt;20&lt;/xref&gt;]. Chang et al. did not find different expression of visfatin between visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue in 53 Taiwanese adults [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\"&gt;21&lt;/xref&gt;]. Nevertheless, there is strong evidence that visfatin increases with obesity as demonstrated in a prospective cohort study, in which visfatin levels were augmented in morbidly obese subjects compared to normal-weight individuals. Visfatin normalized after 6 months of bariatric surgery and consequent weight loss [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\"&gt;22&lt;/xref&gt;]. Altogether current evidence does not support the notion that visfatin is predominantly expressed in visceral fat [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\"&gt;21&lt;/xref&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Visfatin in glucose metabolism&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the study by Fukuhara suggested a role of visfatin on glucose metabolism, others have investigated its relationship with T2DM, insulin secretion and sensitivity, and also with other adipokines such as adiponectin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revollo et al. showed that visfatin is an essential enzyme in NAD production (Nampt). It exists both in intra and extracellular environments. Mice heterozygous for mutations in the visfatin gene have glucose intolerance mainly due to insulin secretion deficiency. This insulin secretion defect can be corrected by administering nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), the product of visfatin on NAD biosynthesis. Since the pancreas has very low levels of intracellular visfatin, the author suggests that maintenance of high NMN circulating levels by extracellular visfatin would be critical for normal beta-cell function [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\"&gt;10&lt;/xref&gt;]. Skop et al. investigated glucose uptake in animal hepatocytes with diminished visfatin expression. They found significantly reduced NAD biosynthesis and significantly decreased incremental glucose uptake after stimulation with insulin when compared to control hepatocytes with normal expression of visfatin [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\"&gt;9&lt;/xref&gt;]. A negative correlation of visfatin levels with beta-cell function was demonstrated by studying acute insulin secretion assessed by an intravenous glucose tolerance test [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\"&gt;23&lt;/xref&gt;]. Furthermore, continuous glucose infusion in humans acutely increases visfatin levels. This effect is suppressed by insulin or somatostatin infusion [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\"&gt;24&lt;/xref&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown and co-authors demonstrated that incubation with visfatin into mouse pancreatic beta-cells caused significant changes in the mRNA expression of several key diabetes-related genes, including marked up-regulation of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 homeobox B (HNF1B) among others. Visfatin also caused a significant 46% increase in insulin secretion compared to control at low glucose, and this increase was blocked by co-incubation with the specific visfatin inhibitor FK866. Both visfatin and NMN induced activation of insulin receptor and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, with visfatin-induced activation of insulin receptor and ERK1/2 being inhibited by FK866. The authors suggested that visfatin can significantly regulate insulin secretion, insulin receptor phosphorylation, and expression of a number of genes associated with beta-cell function in mice [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\"&gt;25&lt;/xref&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visfatin levels were also investigated in some population based studies. Chen et al., investigating visfatin levels in a Chinese population, found a positive association between visfatin and the presence of T2DM, even after adjustment for BMI, age, sex, smoking status, blood pressure, and lipid profile [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\"&gt;26&lt;/xref&gt;]. Dogru et al., studying visfatin levels in 40 subjects with newly diagnosed diabetes or glucose intolerance, found that visfatin levels were higher in the diabetic patients when compared to controls, but not when compared to glucose intolerant patients (pre-diabetes)[&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\"&gt;27&lt;/xref&gt;]. Patients with both long duration type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and T2DM had higher visfatin levels compared to non-diabetic controls or recently diagnosed diabetic individuals. In T2DM, visfatin levels were partly associated to higher glycated hemoglobin levels (A1C) [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\"&gt;23&lt;/xref&gt;]. Nevertheless, Takebayashi found no correlation between diabetes and visfatin [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\"&gt;18&lt;/xref&gt;], while another study, demonstrated decreased visfatin in patients with T1DM and inverse relationship between A1C and visfatin levels [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\"&gt;28&lt;/xref&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between visfatin levels and insulin resistance surrogates was also investigated. However, it was not possible to demonstrate correlation of visfatin with HOMA-IR [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\"&gt;20&lt;/xref&gt;,&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\"&gt;23&lt;/xref&gt;]. HOMA-IR also did not show correlation with visfatin expression on visceral adipose tissue but was positively associated with visfatin expression in subcutaneous adipocytes [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\"&gt;21&lt;/xref&gt;]. Furthermore, administration of the insulin sensitizer pioglitazone for 3 weeks didn't affect plasma levels of visfatin in humans with recently diagnosed T2DM [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\"&gt;29&lt;/xref&gt;]. The same drug administered for 12 weeks did not change visfatin levels either [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\"&gt;18&lt;/xref&gt;]. This is not, apparently, a general effect of thiazolidinediones, since rosiglitazone administered for 3 weeks increased visfatin levels in normoglycemic individuals [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\"&gt;30&lt;/xref&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current data suggests that visfatin is important to normal insulin secretion, but its relationship with diabetes risk and progression is still a matter of debate. Thus, visfatin may be a compensatory mechanism or part of the pathophysiology of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Cardiovascular disease and visfatin&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxidized LDL was verified to increase visfatin expression in cultured monocytes. Moreover, visfatin increased the expression of molecules that degrade extracellular matrix causing plaque instability. This later effect was abolished after adding an inhibitor of insulin receptor signaling [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\"&gt;31&lt;/xref&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visfatin expression is increased in unstable coronary plaques and symptomatic carotid lesions in humans. Patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy and presenting ischemic symptoms 6 months prior to evaluation had higher visfatin expression than asymptomatic individuals. The same finding has been replicated in patients with unstable angina compared to those with stable angina. Immunohistochemical analysis of the plaques revealed higher concentration of visfatin in their lipid nucleuses compared to stable plaques. The same study showed that balloon angioplasty, acutely injuring the plaques, caused visfatin levels to peak 4 hours after the procedure, receding back to basal levels after 24 hours. Another study found a negative correlation between visfatin and endothelial function evaluated through flow-mediated or nitroglycerin-mediated dilation [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\"&gt;18&lt;/xref&gt;]. Visfatin can promote vascular smooth muscle inflammation, being associated with a potential role in vascular dysfunction and inflammation associated with some metabolic disorders [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\"&gt;32&lt;/xref&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased visfatin levels are associated to coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute coronary syndromes even after correction for classic cardiovascular risk factors such as cholesterol, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\"&gt;33&lt;/xref&gt;]. A positive association between visfatin and MS was noted, mainly among individuals with carotid atherosclerosis. Indeed, visfatin was an independent risk factor for augmented carotid intimal-media thickness [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\"&gt;34&lt;/xref&gt;]. In this regard, it is well established that acute ischemic stroke is another possible consequence of atherosclerosis. Recently, higher visfatin levels were found in Chinese individuals with stroke, suggesting a possible role in this vascular disease [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\"&gt;35&lt;/xref&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cardioprotective effect of visfatin was also suggested in an animal model of non-atherosclerotic ischemia and reperfusion [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\"&gt;36&lt;/xref&gt;]. Visfatin administered at the moment of reperfusion diminished the size of the infarcted area. This effect was mediated by the inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, a non-specific mitochondrial channel, its opening in the first few minutes of myocardial reperfusion being a critical determinant of cardiomyocyte death. The authors emphasize that this was an acute effect and chronically elevated levels of visfatin may yield different results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Genetic studies&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visfatin/PBEF gene consists of 11 exons and 10 introns spanning 34.7-kb and is located on chromosome 7q22.2. Few studies of polymorphic markers in the visfatin gene have been reported to date. Bottcher et al. [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\"&gt;37&lt;/xref&gt;] did not find any association with either T2DM, in a cohort of 503 diabetic subjects and 476 healthy controls, or with T2DM-related traits in 626 non-diabetic subjects from Germany. However, they found an association between the -948 G &amp;#x0003e; T single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and fasting insulin levels in non-diabetic subjects (&lt;italic&gt;p &lt;/italic&gt;&amp;#x0003c; 0.05). The ratio of visceral/subcutaneous visfatin mRNA expression was associated with all three genetic polymorphisms studied (rs9770242, -948G &amp;#x0003e; T, rs4730153).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate the role of visfatin gene variants in obesity-related phenotypes, Bailey et al. [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\"&gt;38&lt;/xref&gt;] genotyped a total of 13 SNPs in the promoter region of the gene in 918 participants from 208 families evaluated in the Quebec Family Study. A significant association was found between two SNPs (rs9770242 and rs1319501) and fasting insulin levels (&lt;italic&gt;p &lt;/italic&gt;= 0.002). These SNPs were also associated with fasting glucose (&lt;italic&gt;p &lt;/italic&gt;= 0.02). Furthermore, they found that a more distal SNP (rs7789066) was significantly associated with the apolipoprotein B component of VLDL (&lt;italic&gt;p &lt;/italic&gt;= 0.012).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhang et al. [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\"&gt;39&lt;/xref&gt;] studied a group of 814 white patients from the USA and a group of non-diabetic controls (n = 320). They found a significant association between -948C &amp;#x0003e; A and T2DM (&lt;italic&gt;p &lt;/italic&gt;= 0.021). In a non-diabetic population (n = 630), the same -948C allele that conferred increased risk of T2DM was significantly associated with higher plasma levels of fibrinogen and C-reactive protein (&lt;italic&gt;p &lt;/italic&gt;= 0.0022 and 0.0038, respectively). However, no significant associations were observed with BMI, waist circumference, serum glucose levels, or fasting insulin levels. They suggested that the visfatin gene may play a role in determining T2DM susceptibility, possibly by modulating chronic, low-grade inflammatory responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Korner et al. [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\"&gt;40&lt;/xref&gt;] studied 731 schoolchildren and an independent cohort of 167 obese children from Germany. They genotyped 3 SNPs (rs9770242, -948G &amp;#x0003e; T, rs4730153). The authors did not find association of any of the 3 polymorphisms or their haplotypes with BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, glucose, insulin, or lipid levels. However, the -948G variant was associated with significantly higher diastolic blood pressure in obese children (&lt;italic&gt;p &lt;/italic&gt;&amp;#x0003c; 0.05 after adjusting for age, sex, pubertal stage, and height).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blakemore et al. [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\"&gt;41&lt;/xref&gt;] studied 1,709 severely obese subjects together with 2,367 T2DM individuals and 2,850 controls. For quantitative trait analysis, an additional 2,362 subjects were typed for rs10487818 from a general population sample. This rare SNP, rs10487818, located in intron 4, was associated with protective effect against severe obesity. This is one of the first rare SNPs shown to be protective against a common polygenic disease like obesity and provides further evidence that rare alleles of strong effect can contribute to this kind of complex diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, Yan et al. [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\"&gt;42&lt;/xref&gt;] suggested that Visfatin -1535C &amp;#x0003e; T polymorphism might be associated with reduced risk of CAD in a Chinese population. There was a significant association between Visfatin -1535C &amp;#x0003e; T polymorphism and triglyceride levels in both CAD patients and controls (&lt;italic&gt;p &lt;/italic&gt;= 0.003). In non diabetic Japanese subjects, Tokunaga et al. [&lt;xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\"&gt;43&lt;/xref&gt;] found that the -1535T/T genotype modulates lipid levels promoting lower serum triglyceride levels and higher HDL-cholesterol levels. In this investigation, reporter gene assay of 3T3-L1 adipocytes revealed that the promoter activity of -1535T and -1535C was similar, suggesting that the observed association may reflect linkage disequilibrium between -1535T &amp;#x0003e; C and other causative variations of the visfatin gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these studies suggest that genetic variants in the Visfatin gene can be associated with some phenotypes related to glucose, lipids, and other metabolic and vascular traits. Further studies in other populations must be carried out to better clarify these points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion and perspectives&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visfatin is is an adipokine involved in inflammatory phenomena, atherosclerosis, and possibly in insulin secretion. Its physiology has begun to be described but its role on diabetes and CAD pathophysiology is still controversial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New studies may define the possible role of visfatin in the mechanisms of glycemic control, vascular function and atherosclerotic process. These findings may contribute in the identification of higher risk individuals as well as lead to new therapeutic approaches.

Visfatin was recently described as an adipocytokine with potentially important effects on glucose metabolism and atherosclerosis. Visfatin has been linked to several inflammatory conditions, beta cell function, and cardiovascular disease. The growing number of publications on the subject shall bring further evidence about this adipocytokine. Its findings may contribute in the identification of higher risk individuals for diabetes and cardiovascular disease with a better comprehension about the complex intercorrelation between adiposity, glucose metabolism and vascular disease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The ongoing global epidemic of atherosclerotic disease is propelled by a concurrent rise in the prevalence of obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In this setting, the coexistence of several cardiovascular risk factors aggregating around the metabolic syndrome (MS), such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia and visceral obesity, is well-known [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. The pathophysiological relationship between cardiovascular disease and these risk factors is of great importance due to their high morbidity and mortality as well as impact on healthcare costs [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>]. Therefore, the link between visceral adiposity and insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, and subsequent atherosclerosis has been extensively studied.</p><p>Adipose tissue is a known endocrine organ secreting several soluble factors, known as adipocytokines or adipokines, some of these being adiponectin, leptin, resistin and, more recently, visfatin. They can partly explain the link between obesity, insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction, endothelial dysfunction, and atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Other known products of adipocytes are free fatty-acids, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, Monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)1, coagulation mediators such as platelet-activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, and complement components [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>].</p><p>Atherosclerosis is a complex inflammatory disease, involving many physiological mechanisms, in which immunologic, metabolic, genetic, and environmental factors interact. The endothelium plays a pivotal role in these interactions, through disequilibrium in regulation of vascular tonus (endothelium-dependent relaxation), platelet aggregation, coagulation, and fibrinolysis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>]. Risk factors for this condition have been continuously identified.</p><p>Adipocytokines may have a role in each one of these processes, explaining at least in part the association between obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Visfatin</title><p>Visfatin is an adipokine identified in 2004 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>] and thus named for the suggestion that it would be predominantly produced and secreted in visceral fat. Visfatin is highly preserved across animal evolution. It has a molecular weight of 52 KDa and its gene encodes 491 aminoacids. It is identical to pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF), described in 1994 as a cytokine produced by lymphocytes, acting on lymphocyte maturation and inflammatory regulation. Visfatin was also soon recognized as the formerly described Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), the limiting enzyme in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis. In addition to being produced in human leukocytes and adipose tissue, visfatin is also expressed in human and animal hepatocytes and muscles [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>] and in animal adipocytes, kidney and heart [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. Visfatin was found to be released predominantly from macrophages rather than from adipocytes in visceral adipose tissue. In this regard, there is sufficient evidence to consider that visfatin is expressed by the macrophages infiltrating adipose tissue and is produced in response to inflammatory signals [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>]. It is now believed that visfatin actions can be endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine as well. These autocrine effects of visfatin may play an important role in regulating insulin sensitivity in the liver [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>].</p><p>Fukuhara et al. investigated genes having diverse patterns of expression in subcutaneous and visceral fat from two human subjects, identifying one gene with this feature [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. Sequencing revealed this gene to correspond to PBEF. Increased visfatin expression and secretion was found during cell differentiation of cultured adipocytes. Moreover, studying 101 humans, strong correlation between visceral fat estimated by computed tomography (CT) and visfatin plasma levels was found, as well as a weak correlation between visfatin levels and subcutaneous fat. Furthermore, an increased visceral fat expression of visfatin was demonstrated after weight gain in obese diabetic mice. In these animals, acute administration of recombinant visfatin decreased plasma glucose in a dose-dependent fashion, in both insulin-resistant and insulin-deficient animals. Chronic increase of visfatin expression obtained by viral transfection has also decreased glucose in both animal models. A homozygous knockout model for the visfatin gene has been attempted, but it was incompatible with life, fetal death occurring in the initial phase of embryogenesis. However, heterozygous animals showed plasma levels of visfatin two-thirds of those seen in wild-type animals, associated to blood glucose slightly higher in fasting, post-prandial state, and after an oral glucose load. In addition, the study has demonstrated insulin-mimetic effects of visfatin such as: increased glucose uptake in adipocytes and myocytes, suppression of hepatic glucose release, stimulated triglyceride accumulation, and increase in its synthesis in pre-adipocytes.</p><p>Further on, the authors investigated the intracellular signaling of visfatin and suggested it to tyrosine-phosphorylate the insulin receptor in hepatocytes, myocytes, and adipocytes. Competitive inhibition testing showed that both molecules do not compete for the insulin receptor, raising the hypothesis that visfatin could have a binding site different from that of insulin. Actually, recombinant receptors with structural changes decreasing affinity for insulin didn't change visfatin binding.</p><p>This study has opened a broad perspective for the role of visfatin in mechanisms of glucose control. Although its insulin-mimetic effects have been questioned, generating a retraction by the author in 2007 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>], numerous subsequent studies demonstrated visfatin to bear important metabolic effects as discussed below.</p></sec><sec><title>General actions of Visfatin and correlations with medical conditions</title><p>Subsequent publications have reported various effects and correlations between visfatin plasma levels with various medical conditions (Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>). It possesses anti-apoptotic effects on neutrophils in both animal and clinical models of sepsis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>]. It is also increased in acute pulmonary lesion, being useful as a marker of this condition [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. Visfatin is also diminished in patients with steatohepatitis when compared to pure steatosis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>]. However, increased visfatin levels correlated positively with portal inflammation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>]. These observations could suggest an association of visfatin with inflammation. Negative correlation of visfatin with creatinine clearance and positive correlation with urinary albumin excretion has been demonstrated, suggesting visfatin circulating levels to be influenced by renal function [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. An inhibitor of visfatin (FK866) is being tested as a potential anti-tumor agent due to NAD depletion leading to apoptosis on highly metabolically active cells [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>].</p><table-wrap id=\"T1\" position=\"float\"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Association between several medical conditions and visfatin</p></caption><table frame=\"hsides\" rules=\"groups\"><thead><tr><th align=\"left\">Medical Condition</th><th align=\"left\">Visfatin</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\">Atherosclerosis</td><td align=\"left\">Increased serum levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">31</xref>]<break/>Increased expression in instable plaques [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">31</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Endothelial dysfunction</td><td align=\"left\">Increased serum levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Cardioprotection</td><td align=\"left\">Reduces infarct area [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Metabolic Syndrome</td><td align=\"left\">Controversial, Increased serum levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Adiponectin</td><td align=\"left\">Controversial [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Hepatic Fat Disease</td><td align=\"left\">Diminished serum levels in steatohepatitis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>]<break/>Increased serum levels with progressive portal inflammation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Tumoral replication</td><td align=\"left\">Visfatin antagonist being tested [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Acute lung injury</td><td align=\"left\">Increased serum levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Renal insufficiency</td><td align=\"left\">Increased serum levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Beta cell function impairment</td><td align=\"left\">Increased serum levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Insulin resistance</td><td align=\"left\">No correlation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Insulin-mimetic effect</td><td align=\"left\">Controversial, no effect [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Diabetes</td><td align=\"left\">Controversial [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Obesity</td><td align=\"left\">Increased serum levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Visceral Fat</td><td align=\"left\">Controversial, no correlation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Vascular smooth muscle</td><td align=\"left\">Promotes inflammation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>]</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The relationship of visfatin with visceral fat has been questioned. Relationship of plasma visfatin levels was seen with body mass index (BMI) and percentage of body fat but not with abdominal circumference or visceral fat estimated by CT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>]. Chang et al. did not find different expression of visfatin between visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue in 53 Taiwanese adults [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>]. Nevertheless, there is strong evidence that visfatin increases with obesity as demonstrated in a prospective cohort study, in which visfatin levels were augmented in morbidly obese subjects compared to normal-weight individuals. Visfatin normalized after 6 months of bariatric surgery and consequent weight loss [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>]. Altogether current evidence does not support the notion that visfatin is predominantly expressed in visceral fat [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Visfatin in glucose metabolism</title><p>After the study by Fukuhara suggested a role of visfatin on glucose metabolism, others have investigated its relationship with T2DM, insulin secretion and sensitivity, and also with other adipokines such as adiponectin.</p><p>Revollo et al. showed that visfatin is an essential enzyme in NAD production (Nampt). It exists both in intra and extracellular environments. Mice heterozygous for mutations in the visfatin gene have glucose intolerance mainly due to insulin secretion deficiency. This insulin secretion defect can be corrected by administering nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), the product of visfatin on NAD biosynthesis. Since the pancreas has very low levels of intracellular visfatin, the author suggests that maintenance of high NMN circulating levels by extracellular visfatin would be critical for normal beta-cell function [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. Skop et al. investigated glucose uptake in animal hepatocytes with diminished visfatin expression. They found significantly reduced NAD biosynthesis and significantly decreased incremental glucose uptake after stimulation with insulin when compared to control hepatocytes with normal expression of visfatin [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>]. A negative correlation of visfatin levels with beta-cell function was demonstrated by studying acute insulin secretion assessed by an intravenous glucose tolerance test [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>]. Furthermore, continuous glucose infusion in humans acutely increases visfatin levels. This effect is suppressed by insulin or somatostatin infusion [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>].</p><p>Brown and co-authors demonstrated that incubation with visfatin into mouse pancreatic beta-cells caused significant changes in the mRNA expression of several key diabetes-related genes, including marked up-regulation of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 homeobox B (HNF1B) among others. Visfatin also caused a significant 46% increase in insulin secretion compared to control at low glucose, and this increase was blocked by co-incubation with the specific visfatin inhibitor FK866. Both visfatin and NMN induced activation of insulin receptor and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, with visfatin-induced activation of insulin receptor and ERK1/2 being inhibited by FK866. The authors suggested that visfatin can significantly regulate insulin secretion, insulin receptor phosphorylation, and expression of a number of genes associated with beta-cell function in mice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>].</p><p>Visfatin levels were also investigated in some population based studies. Chen et al., investigating visfatin levels in a Chinese population, found a positive association between visfatin and the presence of T2DM, even after adjustment for BMI, age, sex, smoking status, blood pressure, and lipid profile [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>]. Dogru et al., studying visfatin levels in 40 subjects with newly diagnosed diabetes or glucose intolerance, found that visfatin levels were higher in the diabetic patients when compared to controls, but not when compared to glucose intolerant patients (pre-diabetes)[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. Patients with both long duration type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and T2DM had higher visfatin levels compared to non-diabetic controls or recently diagnosed diabetic individuals. In T2DM, visfatin levels were partly associated to higher glycated hemoglobin levels (A1C) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>]. Nevertheless, Takebayashi found no correlation between diabetes and visfatin [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>], while another study, demonstrated decreased visfatin in patients with T1DM and inverse relationship between A1C and visfatin levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>].</p><p>The relationship between visfatin levels and insulin resistance surrogates was also investigated. However, it was not possible to demonstrate correlation of visfatin with HOMA-IR [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>]. HOMA-IR also did not show correlation with visfatin expression on visceral adipose tissue but was positively associated with visfatin expression in subcutaneous adipocytes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>]. Furthermore, administration of the insulin sensitizer pioglitazone for 3 weeks didn't affect plasma levels of visfatin in humans with recently diagnosed T2DM [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>]. The same drug administered for 12 weeks did not change visfatin levels either [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. This is not, apparently, a general effect of thiazolidinediones, since rosiglitazone administered for 3 weeks increased visfatin levels in normoglycemic individuals [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>].</p><p>Current data suggests that visfatin is important to normal insulin secretion, but its relationship with diabetes risk and progression is still a matter of debate. Thus, visfatin may be a compensatory mechanism or part of the pathophysiology of diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Cardiovascular disease and visfatin</title><p>Oxidized LDL was verified to increase visfatin expression in cultured monocytes. Moreover, visfatin increased the expression of molecules that degrade extracellular matrix causing plaque instability. This later effect was abolished after adding an inhibitor of insulin receptor signaling [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">31</xref>].</p><p>Visfatin expression is increased in unstable coronary plaques and symptomatic carotid lesions in humans. Patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy and presenting ischemic symptoms 6 months prior to evaluation had higher visfatin expression than asymptomatic individuals. The same finding has been replicated in patients with unstable angina compared to those with stable angina. Immunohistochemical analysis of the plaques revealed higher concentration of visfatin in their lipid nucleuses compared to stable plaques. The same study showed that balloon angioplasty, acutely injuring the plaques, caused visfatin levels to peak 4 hours after the procedure, receding back to basal levels after 24 hours. Another study found a negative correlation between visfatin and endothelial function evaluated through flow-mediated or nitroglycerin-mediated dilation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. Visfatin can promote vascular smooth muscle inflammation, being associated with a potential role in vascular dysfunction and inflammation associated with some metabolic disorders [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>].</p><p>Increased visfatin levels are associated to coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute coronary syndromes even after correction for classic cardiovascular risk factors such as cholesterol, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>]. A positive association between visfatin and MS was noted, mainly among individuals with carotid atherosclerosis. Indeed, visfatin was an independent risk factor for augmented carotid intimal-media thickness [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>]. In this regard, it is well established that acute ischemic stroke is another possible consequence of atherosclerosis. Recently, higher visfatin levels were found in Chinese individuals with stroke, suggesting a possible role in this vascular disease [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>].</p><p>A cardioprotective effect of visfatin was also suggested in an animal model of non-atherosclerotic ischemia and reperfusion [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. Visfatin administered at the moment of reperfusion diminished the size of the infarcted area. This effect was mediated by the inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, a non-specific mitochondrial channel, its opening in the first few minutes of myocardial reperfusion being a critical determinant of cardiomyocyte death. The authors emphasize that this was an acute effect and chronically elevated levels of visfatin may yield different results.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic studies</title><p>The visfatin/PBEF gene consists of 11 exons and 10 introns spanning 34.7-kb and is located on chromosome 7q22.2. Few studies of polymorphic markers in the visfatin gene have been reported to date. Bottcher et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] did not find any association with either T2DM, in a cohort of 503 diabetic subjects and 476 healthy controls, or with T2DM-related traits in 626 non-diabetic subjects from Germany. However, they found an association between the -948 G &#x0003e; T single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and fasting insulin levels in non-diabetic subjects (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05). The ratio of visceral/subcutaneous visfatin mRNA expression was associated with all three genetic polymorphisms studied (rs9770242, -948G &#x0003e; T, rs4730153).</p><p>To investigate the role of visfatin gene variants in obesity-related phenotypes, Bailey et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>] genotyped a total of 13 SNPs in the promoter region of the gene in 918 participants from 208 families evaluated in the Quebec Family Study. A significant association was found between two SNPs (rs9770242 and rs1319501) and fasting insulin levels (<italic>p </italic>= 0.002). These SNPs were also associated with fasting glucose (<italic>p </italic>= 0.02). Furthermore, they found that a more distal SNP (rs7789066) was significantly associated with the apolipoprotein B component of VLDL (<italic>p </italic>= 0.012).</p><p>Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] studied a group of 814 white patients from the USA and a group of non-diabetic controls (n = 320). They found a significant association between -948C &#x0003e; A and T2DM (<italic>p </italic>= 0.021). In a non-diabetic population (n = 630), the same -948C allele that conferred increased risk of T2DM was significantly associated with higher plasma levels of fibrinogen and C-reactive protein (<italic>p </italic>= 0.0022 and 0.0038, respectively). However, no significant associations were observed with BMI, waist circumference, serum glucose levels, or fasting insulin levels. They suggested that the visfatin gene may play a role in determining T2DM susceptibility, possibly by modulating chronic, low-grade inflammatory responses.</p><p>Korner et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] studied 731 schoolchildren and an independent cohort of 167 obese children from Germany. They genotyped 3 SNPs (rs9770242, -948G &#x0003e; T, rs4730153). The authors did not find association of any of the 3 polymorphisms or their haplotypes with BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, glucose, insulin, or lipid levels. However, the -948G variant was associated with significantly higher diastolic blood pressure in obese children (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05 after adjusting for age, sex, pubertal stage, and height).</p><p>Blakemore et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>] studied 1,709 severely obese subjects together with 2,367 T2DM individuals and 2,850 controls. For quantitative trait analysis, an additional 2,362 subjects were typed for rs10487818 from a general population sample. This rare SNP, rs10487818, located in intron 4, was associated with protective effect against severe obesity. This is one of the first rare SNPs shown to be protective against a common polygenic disease like obesity and provides further evidence that rare alleles of strong effect can contribute to this kind of complex diseases.</p><p>More recently, Yan et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] suggested that Visfatin -1535C &#x0003e; T polymorphism might be associated with reduced risk of CAD in a Chinese population. There was a significant association between Visfatin -1535C &#x0003e; T polymorphism and triglyceride levels in both CAD patients and controls (<italic>p </italic>= 0.003). In non diabetic Japanese subjects, Tokunaga et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>] found that the -1535T/T genotype modulates lipid levels promoting lower serum triglyceride levels and higher HDL-cholesterol levels. In this investigation, reporter gene assay of 3T3-L1 adipocytes revealed that the promoter activity of -1535T and -1535C was similar, suggesting that the observed association may reflect linkage disequilibrium between -1535T &#x0003e; C and other causative variations of the visfatin gene.</p><p>Taken together, these studies suggest that genetic variants in the Visfatin gene can be associated with some phenotypes related to glucose, lipids, and other metabolic and vascular traits. Further studies in other populations must be carried out to better clarify these points.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion and perspectives</title><p>Visfatin is is an adipokine involved in inflammatory phenomena, atherosclerosis, and possibly in insulin secretion. Its physiology has begun to be described but its role on diabetes and CAD pathophysiology is still controversial.</p><p>New studies may define the possible role of visfatin in the mechanisms of glycemic control, vascular function and atherosclerotic process. These findings may contribute in the identification of higher risk individuals as well as lead to new therapeutic approaches. Genetic studies about the visfatin gene and its variations will also contribute to the elucidation of these phenomena.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>BMI: body mass index; CAD: coronary artery disease; CT: computed tomography; mPTP: mitochondrial permeability transition pore; MS: metabolic syndrome; NAD: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; Nampt: nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; NMN: nicotinamide mononucleotide; PBEF: pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor; SNP: single-nucleotide polymorphism; T1DM: type 1 diabetes mellitus; T2DM; type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PSR and CSVO performed the literature review and drafted the manuscript; FMAG supervised the project, helped in literature review and critically revised the manuscript for important intellectual content.

The diagnostic criteria include two out of three features: hyperandrogenism, polycystic ovaries on ultrasound and menstrual irregularities (Rotterdam Criteria 2003). PCOS patients are more vulnerable to develop diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance (IR) is prevalent in women with PCOS independently of obesity and is critically involved in reproductive and metabolic complications of the syndrome. Several tests have been developed to measure IR, some very reliable but complex like the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp and others less precise but easier and less invasive like HOMA-IR. New markers are needed to reach a more reliable assessment of insulin resistance. To date, several surrogate markers have been proposed in the literature to facilitate and improve the determination of IR. Many new proteins are strongly involved with PCOS physiopathology and IR, such as some adipocytokines (adiponectin, visfatin, vaspin and apelin), copeptin, irisin, PAI-1 and zonulin. Many other proteins have been proposed as potential new markers of IR in PCOS, such as resistin, leptin, RBP4, kisspetin and ghrelin, but their role is still controversial. In this review, we provide a short characterization of these new markers, recently studied as indicators of metabolic state.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang=\"en\"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Polycystic ovary syndrome</kwd><kwd>Insulin resistance</kwd><kwd>Markers</kwd><kwd>Adipocytokines</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id=\"Sec1\" sec-type=\"introduction\"><title>Introduction</title><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disease linked with metabolic complications, and insulin resistance (IR) plays an important role in the development and persistence of this disorder [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR1\">1</xref>].

The homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) is the main method for IR measurement used in scientific studies because it is a simple and noninvasive [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>]. Due to the relevance of IR in the setting of PCOS, it would be important for both research and clinical application to identify additional biochemical parameters that may help in identifying IR.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec2\"><title>PCOS and insulin resistance</title><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder affecting 10&#x02013;15&#x000a0;% of women in reproductive age. The etiology of the disease is still not totally understood, and the clinical presentation is extremely variable but generally includes clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, menstrual disorders (oligo-amenorrhea) and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound.</p><p>In the last years, specific diagnostic criteria were developed to allow the diagnosis of PCOS. In 1990 were established the criteria of the National Institute of Health (NIH), followed by ESHRE/ASRM (European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology/American Society of Reproduction Medicine) criteria established in Rotterdam in 2003. After exclusion of other diseases, the diagnosis of PCOS requires two out of the following three criteria: oligo-anovulation, clinical or biochemical androgen excess, ultrasound polycystic morphology of at least one ovary (at least 12 follicles measuring 2&#x02013;9&#x000a0;mm in diameter or ovarian volume greater than 10&#x000a0;cm<sup>3</sup>).</p><p>In 2011, the Amsterdam ESHRE/ASMR-sponsored 3rd PCOS Consensus Workshop Group identified different PCOS phenotypes, separating the classic phenotype (hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation, with or without PCO) from those with ovulation disorders and polycystic morphology [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR4\">4</xref>].</p><p>The clinical phenotypes present different metabolic risks, and IR is a hallmark of the classic and the ovulatory phenotypes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>]. IR and hyperinsulinemia determine hyperandrogenemia stimulating ovarian theca cells to secrete androgens and increasing LH effect on ovarian androgen production. Both androgens and insulin inhibit SHBG secretion, increasing free and bioactive androgen levels and making clinical androgen excess worse. Moreover, IR is critically involved in the development of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease in PCOS women, that is why its treatment (lifestyle changes, insulin-sensitizing drugs and bariatric surgery) is thought to important both to decrease IR and to alleviate its consequences [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>].</p><p>Measuring insulin resistance is neither simple nor necessarily accurate. This is why several tests have been developed to quantify this metabolic phenomenon. Some of these tests are very reliable but complex, while others are less precise but more readily usable in clinical research due to simplicity and reduced invasiveness. Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp is the gold standard for directly determining metabolic insulin sensitivity. It consists in a constant insulin infusion resulting in a new steady-state insulin level above the fasting level that enhances glucose disposal in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and inhibits hepatic glucose production. 20&#x000a0;% dextrose is given to &#x0201c;clamp&#x0201d; blood glucose levels in the euglycemic range. This technique directly measures all body glucose disposal under steady-state insulin conditions, but it is time consuming, labor intensive, expensive and technically demanding [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>].</p><p>The homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) determines IR and pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell function from basal glucose and insulin (or C-peptide) levels with a simple mathematically derived nonlinear equation (HOMA-IR: fasting insulin (mU/ml)&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;fasting glucose (mmol/l)/22.5 (normalizing factor)) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>].</p><p>The quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) is a simple variation of the HOMA equation that provides a consistent and accurate insulin sensitivity index with positive predictive power and with a significantly better correlation with glucose clamp determinations of insulin sensitivity than other simple surrogates [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>]. It is easy, minimally invasive, inexpensive and commonly used in clinical research studies.</p><p>The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is a simple test widely used in medical practice to identify glucose intolerance or type 2 diabetes. After an oral glucose load (75&#x000a0;g), blood glucose and insulin concentrations are determined at 0, 30, 60 and 120&#x000a0;min. OGTT provides important information about glucose tolerance, but not insulin sensitivity/resistance per se [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR8\">8</xref>].</p><p>The minimal model analysis of the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT) is a simple indirect measurement of insulin sensitivity/resistance. Blood samples are taken for 3&#x000a0;h after an intravenous bolus of glucose administration followed by an insulin infusion. The collected data are analyzed using a computer program MINMOD to provide an insulin sensitivity index [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR9\">9</xref>].</p><p>Matsuda index is a simple assessment of insulin sensitivity from the OGTT that provides an excellent approximation of whole-body insulin sensitivity (WBISI&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10,000/&#x0221a; (fasting glucose&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;fasting insulin) (mean glucose&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;mean insulin) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec3\"><title>New markers: structure, action and role in insulin resistance</title><p>Although several tests exist to assess insulin resistance, the availability of new markers is highly needed, in the aim to achieve a more reliable assessment of insulin metabolism. To date, a number of new proteins have been proposed as surrogate markers for the assessment of insulin resistance. Below, we provide a short characterization of markers, which have recently been studied as serum/plasma indicators of metabolic state.</p><sec id=\"Sec4\"><title>Adipocytokines</title><p>Adipose tissue is implicated in the secretion of several hormones such as adiponectin, resistin, leptin, visfatin, apelin, retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP 4), called adipocytokines, that are involved in energy homeostasis and metabolism [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR11\">11</xref>].</p><p>Adiponectin is secreted exclusively by mature adipocytes. Decreased adiponectin plasma levels are associated with insulin resistance [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR12\">12</xref>], obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>]. There are many scientific studies on adiponectin in PCOS patients. Sepilian and Nagamani [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>] reported a significant negative correlation between serum adiponectin levels and insulin resistance, with no correlation between BMI and adiponectin in PCOS patients, suggesting that insulin sensitivity seems to be the major determinant of adiponectin levels rather than adiposity.</p><p>Panidis et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>] observed lower serum adiponectin levels in PCOS patients with insulin resistance (measured by HOMA-IR) than in normal population. Similar findings were observed by Yildiz et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>] who demonstrated a relationship between increased insulin resistance and decreased adiponectin levels, suggesting that it could be an adequate marker of insulin resistance and its consequences such as diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome.</p><p>Resistin is an adipose-derived peptide hormone discovered in 2001 that potentially links obesity and diabetes mellitus [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref>]. The role of resistin in insulin resistance of PCOS is still controversial. Seow et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>] found that hyperinsulinemic PCOS patients and controls had similar serum resistin levels, but resistin mRNA levels were twofold higher in adipocytes from PCOS patients, suggesting a paracrine regulation of insulin resistance. Lewandowski et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR19\">19</xref>] reported a strong negative correlation between adiponectin and resistin levels in PCOS women during OGTT but without a direct correlation with insulin resistance, and they speculated that the adiponectin-to-resistin ratio might help in predicting the cardiovascular risk in these patients. Higher resistin levels were found in PCOS patients by Yilmaz et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>], but independently from insulin resistance and BMI. Wang et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>] observed significantly higher resistin levels in obese and non-obese PCOS groups than in controls and HOMA-IR had a positive correlation with resistin and a negative correlation with adiponectin. Conversely, Pangaribuan et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR22\">22</xref>] found that none of the 24 PCOS patients in their study presented hyperesistinemia, there was no significant difference in serum resistin concentration between PCOS group and controls, and there was no correlation with BMI and HOMA-IR; instead, they showed that lower adiponectin level was associated with insulin resistance and BMI in PCOS women.</p><p>Leptin is a peptide hormone secreted from adipose tissue and plays an important role in food intake and energy homeostasis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. Insulin stimulates leptin gene expression, enhancing leptin secretion [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>]. The implication of leptin in insulin resistance of PCOS is still unclear. Mici&#x00107; et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR25\">25</xref>] found significantly higher leptin levels in obese PCOS patients compared with non-obese PCOS women and controls with a negative correlation between insulin sensitivity and leptin levels in both PCOS groups. Some years later, Erturk et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR26\">26</xref>] did not reveal significant correlation between leptin and HOMA-IR or hyperinsulinemia, suggesting that leptin levels are related only to obesity. Opposite results were obtained by Pehlivanov and Mitkov [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR27\">27</xref>], who showed a positive correlation between serum leptin levels and insulin resistance, independently of obesity. One possible explanation for this difference is the heterogeneity of the patients, who presented the BMI in the upper limit of normal values. Recently, similar to Erturk&#x02019;s study, Nasrat et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR28\">28</xref>] found that leptin and BMI were significantly correlated without a significant association with insulin resistance, but they evaluated only PCOS patients without a control group and they did not analyze the molecular mechanisms for further validation. Garruti et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR29\">29</xref>] reported low leptin levels in serum and in follicular fluid in non-obese PCOS patients undergoing in vitro fertilization, with a significant correlation with BMI and insulinemia.</p><p>In 2005, Fukuhara and his group isolated a new adipocytokine called visfatin, which expression increases in obesity. Visfatin has an insulin-mimetic effect in mice and in vitro reduces plasma glucose levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR31\">31</xref>]. Kowalska et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR32\">32</xref>] reported lower insulin sensitivity in both lean and obese PCOS patients, but increased serum visfatin levels only in lean PCOS women with a negative correlation with insulin sensitivity and a positive correlation with markers of hyperandrogenism, suggesting that obesity may deregulate visfatin expression and that other factors may be involved in this process. Similar findings in non-obese PCOS subjects were observed by Gen et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR33\">33</xref>], who reported also a strong association with total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein and markers of hyperandrogenism. Later, in a study performed on obese PCOS adolescent girls, Cekmez et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR34\">34</xref>] showed a significant enhancement of HOMA-IR and visfatin and apelin levels and significantly lower adiponectin levels, speculating that adipocytokines can be used as specific markers for insulin resistance. Nevertheless, a recent meta-analysis including 1341 patients indicated visfatin levels were significantly elevated in PCOS subjects, suggesting that visfatin could be a potential biomarker for PCOS, but there was no correlation with insulin resistance, BMI and hyperandrogenism [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR35\">35</xref>].</p><p>Visceral adipose tissue-derived serine protease inhibitor (vaspin) is a novel adipocytokine identified in obese diabetic rats, where it improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR36\">36</xref>]. In a small case&#x02013;control study performed by Tan et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR37\">37</xref>], obese PCOS women had enhanced vaspin mRNA and protein in omental adipose tissue and high plasma vaspin levels, which decreased after treatment with metformin. Positive associations with HOMA-IR and glucose were found, suggesting that high vaspin levels may be a consequence of insulin resistance. Similar results were found by Koiou et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR38\">38</xref>]. In their study, serum vaspin levels were higher in both lean and obese PCOS patients than in controls. QUICKI was lower in PCOS subjects, suggesting that insulin resistance and obesity enhance vaspin levels. However, treatment with metformin, diet and weight loss appeared to not affect serum vaspin concentrations.</p><p>Apelin is a peptide isolated from bovine stomachs, but it is expressed in several other organs and also in visceral and subcutaneous tissues [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>]. Apelin was found to be higher in PCOS patients by G&#x000f6;ren et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>] but without a significant correlation with HOMA-IR. Olszanecka-Glinianowicz et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>] reported an inverse association between apelin and glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR values, supporting the role of apelin in the regulation of insulin sensitivity. Apelin levels were higher in non-obese PCOS patients, suggesting a compensatory mechanism for metabolic consequences of insulin resistance. Different from Cekmez&#x02019;s study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR34\">34</xref>], lower serum concentrations of apelin were found in PCOS subjects by Altinkaya et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>] with positive correlation with BMI, insulin, HOMA-IR, triglyceride and free testosterone, speculating that apelin can be used as a marker for insulin sensitivity. Conversely, Sun et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>] observed significantly enhanced apelin concentration in PCOS patients with positive association with BMI and HOMA-IR; treatment with drospirenone-ethinylestradiol plus metformin improved insulin resistance and apelin levels. Discrepant findings among the published studies may be attributed to the differences in ethnicity, age, study design, sample size, genetic characteristics of populations, and assessment methodology.</p><p>The data concerning serum retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), an adipocytokine involved in systemic insulin resistance, are inconclusive. Weiping et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>] found elevated RBP4 levels in PCOS patients regardless of obesity with negative correlation with insulin sensitivity, suggesting that this protein could be an important link between adipose tissue and insulin resistance in PCOS. In line with this study, M&#x000f6;hlig et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>] observed that elevated RBP4 levels were significantly associated with insulin resistance. RBP4 levels were higher in women suffering from metabolic syndrome or impaired glucose metabolism, but ROC curve analysis showed that plasma RBP4 does not appear to be a clinically useful parameter to predict metabolic consequences in PCOS women. On the other hand, Hanh et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>] noted that RBP4 were associated with obesity but not with indices of insulin resistance and they found no differences in RBP4 concentrations between PCOS patients and controls, concluding that its levels are not influenced by PCOS per se. No correlation with insulin resistance was found also by Hutchison et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR47\">47</xref>], who noted that RBP levels did not change after treatment with metformin or oral contraceptives, which reduced and enhanced insulin resistance, respectively, concluding that RBP4 cannot be used as a marker of insulin resistance in PCOS. Cohort size, the choice of methodology for the evaluation of insulin resistance, selection bias or methodological differences in RBP4 measurements could contribute to obscure this relatively small impact on IR observed. Recently, contrarily to previous studies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>], Olszanecka-Glinianowicz et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR48\">48</xref>] reported significantly higher RBP4 levels in normal weight PCOS compared to obese PCOS subjects and significantly lower concentrations in normal weight controls compared to obese controls, with a negative correlation between RBP4 and HOMA-IR or insulin concentrations, hypothesizing a compensatory effect in the negative feedback between RBP4 and insulin resistance to prevent deterioration in obese PCOS patients.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec5\"><title>Kisspeptin</title><p>In the literature, there are limited data about kisspeptin changes and hormonal and metabolic diseases. Kisspeptin, also called metastin, is a peptide produced by KiSS-1 gene involved in puberty activation and is the key stimulating factor of GnRH pulsatile secretion during the ovulation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR49\">49</xref>]. Panidis et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR50\">50</xref>] found lower kisspeptin serum levels in PCOS women than in controls, and they reported significantly higher kisspeptin levels in normal weight PCOS subjects than in overweight or obese women with the disease with negative correlation with BMI, androgens, fasting insulin levels and HOMA-IR, suggesting that insulin resistance is linked to decreased kisspeptin levels. In this study, the number of control women was relatively small and no lean healthy volunteers were involved. Therefore, it is too soon to draw definite conclusions. Different findings were reported by Jeon et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR51\">51</xref>] and Yilmaz et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR52\">52</xref>], who observed that kisspeptin levels were significantly increased in normal weight and obese PCOS women compared with controls with positive correlation with androgenic profile but without significant association with insulin resistance, suggesting that kisspeptin can be used as a specific marker for hyperandrogenism in PCOS. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the role of kisspeptin in metabolic consequences in PCOS.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec6\"><title>Copeptin</title><p>To date, few studies were performed to assess the connection between plasma copeptin levels and metabolic risk in PCOS. Saleem et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR53\">53</xref>] performed a multicenter, community-based study on 1293 African-Americans and 1197 non-Hispanic whites to investigate the association of copeptin, the C-terminal pro-vasopressin fragment, with insulin resistance and presence of metabolic syndrome. In both groups, copeptin levels were higher in participants with metabolic syndrome with positive correlation with insulin levels and HOMA-IR and independent association with adiposity and dyslipidemia, suggesting that copeptin may be a novel marker of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Karbek et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR54\">54</xref>] found enhanced copeptin levels in PCOS patients positively associated with fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, androgenic profile, triglycerides and carotid intima media thickness, indicating that copeptin may play an important role in cardiometabolic consequences in PCOS. Similar findings were observed by Taskin et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR55\">55</xref>], who reported that enhanced copeptin levels in obese PCOS women were associated with insulin resistance and obesity.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec7\"><title>Irisin</title><p>Irisin is a novel myokine recently identified in humans and mice involved in brown-fat-like development of white fat, energy expenditure, weight loss and improved glucose tolerance [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR56\">56</xref>]. The relationship between irisin and insulin resistance is still not totally elucidated, and the regulation of this myokine has yet to be demonstrated. Li et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR57\">57</xref>] demonstrated that irisin levels were significantly higher in PCOS subjects than in controls and in overweight and obese patients than in lean women in both groups. Significant positive correlation between circulating irisin with insulin resistance and dyslipidemia was found. They studied the effect of hyperinsulinemia on irisin levels with the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp: At the beginning of the assay, short-term hyperinsulinemia determined a rapid decrease of irisin concentrations in both groups, and therefore, during the steady state of the test, its levels were constant, suggesting that elevated irisin concentrations in PCOS patients may be a consequence of metabolic stress. After metformin therapy, authors observed significantly decreased irisin levels and improved insulin resistance in PCOS women. Recently, similar results were obtained by Li et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR58\">58</xref>], who noted significantly increased irisin levels in overweight and obese PCOS women with high free androgen index (FAI) with an evident increase in insulin resistance and hyperandrogenemia, suggesting that elevated irisin levels predict insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and hyperandrogenemia.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec8\"><title>Ghrelin</title><p>Ghrelin is a multifunctional peptide hormone secreted principally in the stomach. It stimulates several biological functions including food intake, glucose release, cell proliferation and reproduction [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR59\">59</xref>]. The first study assessing the relationship between ghrelin levels and insulin resistance in PCOS was performed by Sch&#x000f6;fl et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR60\">60</xref>], who compared PCOS women with healthy controls and gastrectomized subjects. In this study, ghrelin levels were lower in insulin-resistant patients and were similar to the levels found in gastrectomized women; in insulin-sensitive PCOS patients, ghrelin concentration was comparable to controls. A significant correlation between ghrelin levels and insulin resistance was found in PCOS women; treatment with metformin improved insulin sensitivity and enhanced serum ghrelin levels, suggesting that its reduction in PCOS may be a cause or a consequence of insulin resistance. Lower ghrelin levels in PCOS patients were also found by Mitkov et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR61\">61</xref>], with a strong negative association with clinical and hormonal indices of insulin resistance. These data are in conflict with Houjeghani&#x02019;s et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR62\">62</xref>] results, who did not observe significant difference in ghrelin concentration between PCOS patients and control group, without correlation with BMI and insulin resistance. Similar results were obtained recently by Cassar et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR63\">63</xref>], who reported that ghrelin and other biomarkers were strongly correlated with obesity rather than PCOS per se and that only PAI-1 may be a predictor of insulin resistance independently of PCOS status. This discrepancy of results may be explained by confounding factors, such as body weight, fat mass, age, hormonal status, and severity of disease. Ghrelin may play an important role in the development of PCOS and metabolic consequences, but to date too much heterogeneity was identified and further studies are necessary to establish the exact relationship between ghrelin levels and PCOS.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec9\"><title>PAI-1</title><p>Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a glycoprotein involved in the coagulation system, seems to play an important role in PCOS and in its metabolic consequences. Sampson et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR64\">64</xref>] reported increased PAI-1 serum concentrations in non-obese PCOS patients with a significant strong association with hyperinsulinemia. Similar findings were observed by Orio et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR65\">65</xref>] and Tarkun et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR66\">66</xref>], suggesting that increased PAI-1 levels may be a predictor factor in cardiovascular risk in PCOS women. Recently, as mentioned before, Cassar et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR67\">67</xref>] found that PAI-1 was the only biomarker linked to insulin resistance in PCOS subject, with high accuracy to predict IR (&#x0003e;70&#x000a0;%), while other biomarkers investigated in the study (ghrelin, visfatin, leptin, C-protein) were more strongly correlated with BMI rather than PCOS status.</p></sec><sec id=\"Sec10\"><title>Zonulin</title><p>Zonulin is a novel eukaryotic protein that reversibly regulates gut permeability opening intestinal tight junctions and seems involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR67\">67</xref>]. The association between zonulin and metabolic disorders has been recently recognized. Moreno-Navarrete et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR68\">68</xref>] investigated the relationship between this protein and obesity and insulin resistance, and they found that zonulin levels appear to be significantly increased in obese and glucose-intolerant subjects with a positive correlation with insulin resistance and inflammatory markers such as IL-6. To date, there is only one study that investigates serum zonulin levels in PCOS patients. Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR69\">69</xref>] reported significantly elevated zonulin levels in women with the disease compared to controls and demonstrated a strong correlation with insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia and severity of menstrual disorders, speculating that increased gut permeability may alter the intestinal barrier determining an inflammatory state that leads to insulin resistance. Further studies are necessary to confirm the role of zonulin and alterations of intestinal permeability in the physiopathology of PCOS.</p></sec></sec><sec id=\"Sec11\" sec-type=\"conclusion\"><title>Conclusions</title><p>With this article, we provide a short characterization of a variety of methods used for the determination of insulin resistance/sensitivity in PCOS patients. The gold standard for direct measurement of insulin sensitivity is the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp technique, but HOMA-IR and QUICKI are the most used methods in the scientific literature [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>]. Many new proteins are now surfacing as potential new markers of insulin resistance in PCOS. In the scientific literature, we found a strong connection between adipocytokines (in particular adiponectin, visfatin, vaspin and apelin), copeptin, irisin, PAI-1 and zonulin with insulin resistance and PCOS physiopathology, while the role of other proteins (such as resistin, leptin, RBP4, kisspetin and ghrelin) is still controversial. Many scientific articles tried to use surrogate markers to simplify the assessment of insulin resistance, anticipate the diagnosis of metabolic and cardiovascular consequences in PCOS, improve the use of medical resources, and reduce costs and side effect. Further studies are necessary to better clarify the role of these proteins with insulin resistance in this syndrome.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type=\"COI-statement\"><title>Compliance with
